Canon sx40 or canon s100 ? 
Which one should i get ? 
Its prettty much the same $$$ , please advice !?????!!!! 
Go with the S100. 
It's more compact, ISO 6400 capability (SX40 only 3200), faster lens at f/2 and the SX40 only f/2.7. 
Both have full 1080 video with stereo recording, so that doesn't matter. 
The S100 has a slightly larger screen and the new digic 5 processor.

What would happen if you flew the flag of South Vietnam in Modern day Vietnam? 
It would be similar to flying the flag of the Third Reich in modern day Germany or in Israel. 
You would be violating the law. 
The police would make you take it down and you may face fines and imprisonment (but definitely not execution.) 
You will also face the ire of most people there. 
They might be imprisoned or executed 
Yes, it would be an execution punishment.

Does Crack Barrel ban employees from having tattoos? 
I'm suppose to start a job at Cracker Barrel, but I can't risk losing the job because I have two visible tattoos on my arm. 
If you know or work there could you enlighten me? 
Why don't you phone another location and ask♥ 
I don't think they ban if the tats aren't offensive and you should make them not noticeable at the time of the interview but once you got the job there nothing they can really say if so you have a sue/case against them

I have a male and female cockatiel, and there are 2 eggs in the bottom of the cage, will they hatch? 
Most likely not, if there is not a bird sitting on the eggs. 
This is hard to tell. 
Cockatiels can lay unfertilized eggs as well. 
Just because you have a male and female, it cannot be guaranteed the two mated. 
You can try picking up the eggs and holding it up against a very bright light. 
If you see a dark spot in the egg, that means it is fertilized and will hatch if cared for properly. 
Have fun. 
Why is the city called Miramar? 
I'm not sure about the origin of the name but they are a lot of different cities with different and unique names like Miramar so it's just a name. 
There's lots of towns called Miramar, it'd help alot if you listed a state or some sort of context you're looking for it in. 
Here's two examples: 
There's a Miramar in Florida, just north of Miami. 
There's also a Miramar in California, the site of a rather large Air Force Base...
Miramar California is a bit north of San Diego.

where can I get morcillas in tampa bay , I will like the argentinian type , but I will to try anothers please? 
I searched all over the internet, but I could not find one place in Tampa Bay that sells morcillas, also known as blood pudding, black pudding and blood sausages. 
I learned that morcillas are basically impossible to find all across the North American region. 
But I did find this website, www.igourmet.com, where they sell all types of sausages, including blood sausages! 
So follow the link at the bottom and buy some blood sausages. 
huh? 
yuck !! 
I don't know, and it is because I don't like them, do you know that, morcillas is coagulated blood from animals, ewww

What is your cats name and why did you name him/her that? 
If you HAVE a cat of course. 
My cats name is Twinky. 
When she was a tiny little kitten she looked like those twinky snack cakes. 
She is a creme tabby and I've had her for over 2 years now. 
I have a siamese lynx name Star we called her that because she has a star pattern on her face. 
And she is the STAR of the family. 
I love her. :) 
I have a Norwegian Forest Cat that is named Achilles bc as a kitten he always attacked your feet when you walked by! 
My cats Called Frank because the year we got him was the year Frank Sinatra died 
He also had bright blue eyes like Frank Sinatra did :) 
what does it mean when a veiled chameleon egg is soft? 
my female chameleon just laid eggs yesterday and today some of the eggs are soft when i mean soft i mean like not like ordinary chameleon eggs. 
They are probably infertile. 
If there is no male they are probably infertile! 
If you take a flash light and shine it through the eggs and you see nothing throw them away! 
If you do not they will start to rot! 
If she has no male to fertilize the eggs, the eggs will aways be infertile. 
if you do have a male but they are not in the same cage or breeding but you touch him then her she will smell his sent and probably lay eggs. 
Hope she stops laying eggs because she will get really skinny! 
If she continues! 
Hope this helps

Take a ferry ride!!! 
It's an amazing experience! 
Is it better to book a cruise online or by a travel agent? 
First time to go on A cruise any and all info is appreciated 
Personally, I don't find a travel agent to be of value to me as I am willing to put in the time doing research on the internet. 
I have not had good experience with travel agents. 
They don't seem to know anything but the hype they are told and the packages they have available to them. 
The one time I actually booked through a travel agent I did not get all of the amenities I had paid for. 
The few times I have consulted with a travel agent I was able to find the same for less on my own, and more options than what they were selling. 
So now I do not bother with them at all. 
best is using an online travel agent 
My Hamster escaped.... NEED HELP NOW!? 
okay.... I have a dog and my mother is really really terrified of hamsters. 
Well last night while I was sleeping, my hamster escaped from his cage. 
He is in my room, but there are so many things inside there, I dunno what to do. 
I have lots of containers in there. 
Anybody give me ideas like a trap or something? 
Find him before he finds the dog food. 
I'm not kidding , I once lost a hamster in my house 3 months later I walk down in the basement and it was as big as a rat. 
It had been eating dog food the whole time. 
It was huge and scared the crap out of me. 
Make sure he isn't trapped somewhere & put a bowl of food out. 
He will come and eat 
Start cleaning and start looking. 
can i have some indoor pet ideas please!!!!!!!!!!!!!? 
i want a small indoor pet that my mother will let me have please help 
i want something cheap east to take care of and something to hopefully fit in my room 
no pet is really easy to take care of. 
they all need love and attn , food, proper surroundings etc. 
the easiest thing would be a fish - but u need to clean the tank weekly, feed it the right amt, etc etc x 
Having a pet isn't easy. 
You should treat all pets like children. 
They require a lot of attention or they get fussy and tear stuff up. 
If you want easy then go with a gold fish or hamster. 
I would go with a small rodent such as a mouse, rat, hamster or gerbil if you want something you can handle and hold. 
Fish are probably the easiest to take care of though. 
french male sensuality? 
Ive been dating a man from brittany france for a couple of months now. 
He's been away for a week and I was thinking of waiting for him in his apartment wearing only his dress shirt. 
Its still a fairly new relationship and we havent had sex yet so its kind of a big deal. 
I just dont want to freak him out or make him feel uncomfortable. 
Is it ok for a woman in french culture to make the first move? 
What do french men find sexy? 
French women are the ones to say yes, the way we say it is not usually as straigthforward as you propose to do. 
Why not wait for him in a sexy dress with lunch or dinner, or a light snack at his house. 
And you take it up from there. 
Just make sure that it is a light meal with little alcohol.
