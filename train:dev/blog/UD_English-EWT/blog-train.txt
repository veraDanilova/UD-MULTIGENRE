Al-Zaman : American forces killed Shaikh Abdullah al-Ani, the preacher at the mosque in the town of Qaim, near the Syrian border. 
[This killing of a respected cleric will be causing us trouble for years to come.] 
DPA: Iraqi authorities announced that they had busted up 3 terrorist cells operating in Baghdad. 
Two of them were being run by 2 officials of the Ministry of the Interior! 
The MoI in Iraq is equivalent to the US FBI, so this would be like having J. Edgar Hoover unwittingly employ at a high level members of the Weathermen bombers back in the 1960s. 
The third was being run by the head of an investment firm. 
You wonder if he was manipulating the market with his bombing targets. 
The cells were operating in the Ghazaliyah and al-Jihad districts of the capital. 
Although the announcement was probably made to show progress in identifying and breaking up terror cells, I don't find the news that the Baathists continue to penetrate the Iraqi government very hopeful. 
It reminds me too much of the ARVN officers who were secretly working for the other side in Vietnam. 
Al-Zaman : Guerrillas killed a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party after kidnapping him in Mosul. 
The police commander of Ninevah Province announced that bombings had declined 80 percent in Mosul, whereas there had been a big jump in the number of kidnappings. 
On Wednesday guerrillas had kidnapped a cosmetic surgeon and his wife while they were on their way home. 
In Suwayrah, Kut Province, two car bombs were discovered before they could be detonated. 
(Kut is in southeastern Iraq and has an overwhelmingly Shiite population, who are on the lookout for Baathist saboteurs and willingly turn them in. 
This willingness is the main difference in the number of bombings in the south as opposed to the center-north of the country.) 
In Baghdad Kadhim Talal Husain, assistant dean at the School of Education at Mustansiriyah University, was assassinated with his driver in the Salikh district. 
Guerrillas killed an engineer, Asi Ali, from Tikrit. 
They also killed Shaikh Hamid 'Akkab, a clan elder of a branch of the Dulaim tribe in Tikrit. 
His mother was also killed in the attack. 
Two other Dulaim leaders have been killed in the past week and a half. 
Guerrillas near Hawijah launched an attack that left 6 dead, including 4 Iraqi soldiers. 
One of them was from the Jubur tribe and was deputy commander of the Hawijah garrison. 
Two hundred members of the Batawi clan of the Dulaim demonstrated in Baghdad on Friday, protesting the killing of their clan elder, Shaikh Kadhim Sarhid and 4 of his sons, by gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms. 
(This is a largely Sunni Arab clan, and some Sunni observers have accused Shiite elements in the government of being behind the assassination; it is more likely the work of Sunni Arab guerrillas punishing the Batawi leaders for cooperating with the Dec. 15 elections.) 
Al-Zaman : The Iraqi High Electoral Commission on Friday denied a request of the Debaathification Commission to exclude 51 individuals from running on party lists in the Dec. 15 elections on grounds of having been sufficiently involved in Baath activities to warrant their being excluded from civil office. 
The Commission said it had no legal grounds for such an exclusion. 
This item is a small one and easily missed. 
But in my view it is highly significant. 
The Debaathification Commission had been pushed by Ahmad Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress very hard, and had pushed many Sunni Arabs into the arms of the guerrillas. 
Chalabi has been increasingly marginalized within Iraq, however, despite his ties of clientelage with Washington and Tehran. 
He is no longer in the dominant Shiite list, the United Iraqi Alliance, and won't have many seats in the new parliament. 
Some 2,000 junior officers of the old Baath army have been recalled to duty in recent months, something Chalabi would have blocked if he could have. 
Now the Electoral Commission is refusing to punish people for mere past Baath Party membership. 
The situation in Iraq is only going to get better this way. 
If someone committed a crime against humanity, prosecute the person. 
If he or she did not, then they should have all the same rights as other Iraqis. 
Al-Sharq al-Awsat reports that a key eyewitness in the trial of Saddam Hussein for a 1982 massacre at Dujail has died. 
A team from the court managed to take his deposition before he died. 
The trial begins again Nov.28. 
In Baghdad the fighting still continues in several areas, mostly in Sadr city and Adhamiya. 
Baghdadis don't venture much out of their neighbourhoods any more, you never know where you might get stuck. 
There has been talk that the night curfew might be implemented again. 
My neighbourhood has been surrounded by American troops for three days now, helicopters have been circling over our heads non-stop. 
Fedayeen are now visible on the street and they have become bolder than ever. 
Yesterday there were tens of them putting road blocks on our street and setting up mortars, they only come out in the open when Americans leave the area, then they start firing mortars indiscriminately and shooting their AK-47's in the air. 
They are setting the road blocks at the exact same positions they were during the war last year, which indicates they are the same people. 
And there is nothing we can do about it really, people who are suggesting that we go out and fight them are living in dream land. 
Even the IP and ICDC have abandoned the neighbourhood, and those are trained and armed, so don't expect scared civilians to do anything except to hide inside and pray a helicopter or a tank doesn't bomb them, and also how are American soldiers going to distinguish the brave and valiant civilians from the Fedayeen? 
Everyone is apprehensive, there is some talk that April 9th and 10th are going to be bloody days. 
Most people haven't gone to work the last few days, although it seems that the rest of Baghdad is 'normal' (if you can define what normal is). 
There are rumours about preparations by slum dwellers for another looting spree against banks, governmental and public property similar to the one that took place last April, and I have already overheard youngsters in my neighbourhood joking about it and saying things like "This time we will be the first to loot, we didn't get anything the last time". 
Mosques are calling for donating blood, food, and medicine for Fallujah, and several convoys have already headed out for Fallujah, most of them returned later though. 
What irritates me is this sudden false 'solidarity' between Sunni and Shi'ite clerics, we all know that they would be glad to get at each others throats when they have the chance, and Shia clerics were describing Fallujan insurgents as 'Ba'athists', 'Saddamites', 'Wahhabis', and 'terrorists' just a few days ago. 
So what happened? 
I guess it's just the old new Arab 'Me against my brother, me and my brother against my cousin, me and my cousin against my enemy', or 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' thing going on again. 
Speaking of Fallujah, we have only Al-Jazeera to rely on for our news from there. 
They have sent over their top reporter Ahmed Mansour to the town, and he is spouting all kinds of propaganda hourly reminding me of Al-Sahhaf. 
"They are targetting ambulances", "American snipers are shooting children and pregnant women", and "They are using cluster bombs against civilians" is all you get to hear from him. 
He did once make an unforgivable error when he mentioned that Fallujan militants were shooting at the Marines from the roofs of mosques and houses in Hay Al-Golan, but of course that is okay for Al-Jazeera. 
Someone who called himself Abu Hafs from the Ibn Al-Khattab Brigades (another new group) was on Al-Jazeera describing the enormous casualties among the Marines and he sweared that American soldiers were mutilating the bodies of dead insurgents. 
Over 300 Iraqis are reported dead and 500 wounded in Fallujah alone. 
Al-Iraqiyah tv said that ICDC were controlling Ramadi. 
Azzaman newspaper mentioned an announcement signed by Abdul Aziz bin Muqrin, an Al-Qaeda operative in Saudi Arabia on an Islamic website 'the voice of Jihad', in which he stated that "although mutilating dead bodies is not originally permitted in Islam, but in this case it is allowed if Muslims use it against infidels to deter them from committing criminal actions". 
He added that "America does not understand anything except the language of force and retaliation, they were kicked out of Somalia in humiliation after that soldier was dragged in Mogadishu for the whole world to see", and that "the day will come when the dead bodies of Americans and Jews would be dragged, defiled, and stepped on in the Arabian peninsula together with their agents and supporters". 
Elena's motorcycle tour through the region around Chernobyl has revived interest in one of the most serious nuclear disasters in history. 
We all know what happened, but even to this day, there are many different versions and opinions on how it happened and what effect Chernobyl will have on the health of people affected by the fallout. 
UPDATE: 
Now you can tour Chernobyl and write your own story. 
This is not a post about fault-finding or assigning blame. 
It is a time to learn what happened and how it may affect the future. 
There was a soothing authoritative UNSCEAR (United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation ) report in 2000 on the health effects of Chernobyl confirming that there was no scientific evidence of any significant radiation-related health effects to most people exposed. 
This was heavily promoted by the Australasian Radiation Protection Society in a press release titled THE MYTHS OF CHERNOBYL which contained the following: 
One of the most widespread myths of recent times is that the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in 1986 caused many thousands of extra cancer deaths in neighbouring regions, and that public health has been severely affected by exposure to radiation. 
Many people still believe that to be true, even though the Ministry of Russian Federation on Civil Defence, Emergencies and Elimination of Conseguences of Natural Disasters (EMERCOM of Russia) reported this in 1996: 
CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT: TEN YEARS ON 
In the last decade, there has been a real and significant increase in childhood and, to a certain extent, adult carcinoma of the thyroid in contaminated regions of the former Soviet Union (Wi940) which should be attributed to the Chernobyl accident until proven otherwise. 
The prestigious IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) published an early report on Chernobyl which was based on information from Russian sources and stated that there was no significant health effects. 
However, in April 2001, the IAEA published Fifteen Years after the Chernobyl Accident - Lessons learned. which contradict the earlier reports. 
Here are some excerpts: 
The dramatic increase in radiation-induced thyroid cancers in children and adolescents in Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, which have been observed since 1991, continues to this day. 
...a drop in the birth rate, a deterioration in women's reproductive health, an increase in complications during pregnancy and birth, and a deterioration in neonatal health.... 
The dynamics of change in the state of health of children affected by the Chernobyl accident in all three countries - Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine - in the post-accident period is characterized by persistent negative tendencies: the morbidity rate is going up, the number of really healthy children is dropping, and disability is increasing . 
As a parent, I can well imagine how painful it must be for those families whose children are succumbing to radiation poisoning. 
There is a lot to learn about Chernobyl. 
Being well-informed will give you certainty and that is desirable in a world of conflicting reports. 
There are a wealth of references on Chernobyl. 
Read some of the following links and draw your own conclusions. 
These links present the many viewpoints that existed and still exist about the disaster called Chernobyl:

I would be interested in hearing what conclusions you reached and what you found that was most convincing. 
radiation: 
As a child in the 50's I had a lot of glandular problems and they treated it with radiation therapy (primitive at best!) and stopped when a lesion on my neck started enlarging--they said it was not CA but stopped the treatments.... 
Remember the old shoe sizing machines that was a form of radiation xray? 
That too was stopped. 
Don't have to mention what radiation has done and is still doing to Hirsohima & Nagaski folks--there can be no doubts about the effects of radiation in Chernobyl....... 
The Chernobyl Children's Project (http://www.adiccp.org/home/default.asp) offers several ways to help the children of that region. 
One of them is the Rest and Recuperation Program, wherein a child can come to the US for a few weeks in the summer. 
Even a little time spent receiving wholesome, uncontaminated food, good medical care, etc. can add years to their lives. 
S. and I have an acquaintance who has hosted several of these children for many years; to see these little ones breaks the heart. 
The urge to protect and gather them all in is almost overwhelming, and makes me more grateful for the blessings I have. 
Take care, my friend, Linda 
I'm sorry to say Elena's story has been revealed to be a fake. 
What do the new al-Qaeda videotape and audio speeches of Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri tell us about the hopes of the remaining top leadership of the organization? 
Because the US and Pakistan have managed to capture or kill about 2/3s of the top 25 al-Qaeda commanders, the middle managers are not in close contact with al-Zawahiri and Bin Laden. 
The tape was a way to signal priorities. 
These are 1) Assassinate or overthrow Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani military "president" who had made a coup in 1999 and has thrown in his lot with the United States against the Taliban and al-Qaeda. 
Musharraf has been trying to purge his officer corps of the substantial number of al-Qaeda sympathizers. 
His military intelligence has captured major figures like Abu Zubayda and Khalid Shaykh Muhammad, as well as nearly 500 other al-Qaeda operatives, over 400 of whom the Pakistanis have turned over to the US. 
Musharraf held elections in October of 2002, in which center-right parties did well, but in which nearly 20 percent of parliament seats went to the fundamentalist religious party coalition, MMA. 
MMA also captured the Northwest Frontier Province, which probably shelters Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, and is in a joint government of Baluchistan Province, also on the Afghanistan border. 
If al-Qaeda can kill Musharraf or instigate a military coup against him by Islamist junior officers, they can hope to catapult the MMA to power as political allies and hosts. 
They would thereby gain control of a major base for terrorist operations, which is also a nuclear power. 
All this is highly unlikely, as with most al-Qaeda crackpot schemes. 
But so was it unlikely that a small group of Arab mujahidin would virtually take over Afghanistan. 
Response: The US must do whatever it can to strengthen the legitimacy of the Pakistani government. 
On the one hand, it should pressure Musharraf to take off his uniform and run for president in a fair election, and to repeal the contentious "Legal Framework Order" that essentially perpetuates his dictatorship. 
On the other, restrictions should be lifted on the mainstream Muslim League-N and Pakistan People's Party, who can defeat the MMA in fair elections if not hogtied by the secret police. 
On the other hand, the US should strong-arm India and Pakistan into a final settlement of the Kashmir issue. 
Al-Zawahiri attempted to use Musharraf's lack of progress in helping the Muslims of that Indian state as a justification for his overthrow. 
The Kashmir issue generates far more terrorism, and even the threat of nuclear war, than Iraq ever did. 
2) Target Israel and encourage the worst elements of the Palestinians by playing on the iron fist policies of the Sharon government. 
Response: The US has succeeded in politically isolating Hamas, and started the process of cutting off its funding. 
This terrorist organization can now only pull off far less sophisticated bombings and attacks. 
It should continue to be defanged. 
But Sharon's iron fist is simply not working as a means of establishing general peace, and the Bush administration will have to finally apply effective pressure on Sharon to stop his outrages in and colonization of the West Bank and Gaza. 
Sharon's hard line has worked in tandem with Hamas's terrorism to ratchet up tensions further and further, which spill over into the Muslim world and serve as a recruiting tool for al-Qaeda in its search for agents willing to hit the United States. 
Israel owes the United States at least this much, in this crisis, to cease militarily unnecessary provocations and establish genuine peace. 
3) Make Iraq another Afghanistan, using the Republican Right's own tactics against them. 
Response: Iraq is actually hostile territory for al-Qaeda, and without Iraqi sympathizers it cannot succeed there. 
By moving quickly to Iraqi sovereignty and improvement of Iraqi lives, the US may be able to get Iraqis on its side, so that they turn in the foreigners. 
Certainly, the Shiites already hate al-Qaeda and would help; likewise the Kurds. 
The problem of mollifying the Sunnis, though, has to be solved to avoid giving al-Qaeda an entrée. 
The Americans have to put away their free-market fetishism for a while and find ways of creating jobs and pumping money into Iraqi households. 
We need an FDR in Iraq, not a Ronald Reagan. 
Of course, the sooner the US soldiers can be withdrawn in favor of less-provocative local or international forces, the better. 
Getting the Spanish out of Iraq isn't nearly as good a rallying cry for al-Qaeda in the Arab world as getting the Americans and British out. 
The thing to keep in mind is that Sunni Arab nationalists and Baathists and local Sunni radicals are likely to remain far more dangerous to the US in Iraq than al-Qaeda infiltrators, and it would be dangerous to take one's eyes off the former ball. 
George W. Bush alleged Thursday that John Edwards lacks the experience necessary to be president. 
The problem with this argument is that Bush lacked the experience necessary to be president when he ran in 2000, so this sort of cheap shot just hoists him by his own petard. 
Let's just remember a seminal Bush moment in 1999: 
' Bush fails reporter's pop quiz on international leaders 
November 5, 1999 
Web posted at: 3:29 p.m. EST (2029 GMT) 
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- 
Texas Gov. George W. Bush is enduring sharp criticism for being unable to name the leaders of four current world hot spots, but President Bill Clinton says Bush "should, and probably will, pick up" those names. 
The front-runner for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination faltered Thursday in an international affairs pop quiz posed by Andy Hiller, a political reporter for WHDH-TV in Boston. 
Bush 
Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, India and Pakistan. 
Bush was only able to give a partial response to the query on the leader of Taiwan, referring to Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui simply as "Lee." 
He could not name the others. 
"Can you name the general who is in charge of Pakistan?" 
Hiller asked, inquiring about Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who seized control of the country October 12. 
"Wait, wait, is this 50 questions?" asked Bush. 
Hiller replied: "No, it's four questions of four leaders in four hot spots." . . . 
Bush, in answering the question about the leader of Pakistan, also said: "The new Pakistani general, he's just been elected -- not elected, this guy took over office. 
It appears this guy is going to bring stability to the country and I think that's good news for the subcontinent." 
Gore released a statement Friday taking Bush to task for his comments on Pakistan's recent coup. 
"I find it troubling that a candidate for president in our country -- the world's oldest democracy -- would characterize the military takeover as "good news," Gore said. 
"Further, I find it even more disturbing that he made these comments about a nation that just last year tested nuclear weapons -- shortly after voicing his public opposition to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
A spokesman for President Clinton also criticized Bush's comments. 
"It is very dangerous for this country to condone the overthrow of democratically elected governments," said David Leavy, spokesman for the National Security Council. 
Not only did Bush not know who General Pervez Musharraf was, he seems to have confused coup-making with "taking office," and moreover went on to suggest that the overthrow of an elected prime minister and the installation in power of the Pakistan military, then the world's strongest supporter of the Taliban, would bring "stability!" 
Musharraf made his coup in part because of the military's anger over Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's willingness to back down from confronting India over Kashmir, so that he explicitly came to power as a warmonger. 
I can't tell you how ominous I found Bush's performance in that interview. 
I still remember him stuttering about "the General," unable to remember Musharraf's name. 
He obviously had no idea what he was talking about, though he demonstrated a number of ill-fated instincts. 
He obviously liked authoritarian rule better than democracy, equating dictatorship with "stability." 
And, he didn't think he needed to know anything about South Asia, with its nuclear giants and radical religious politics--the latter a dire security threat to the US. 
He couldn't tell when things were becoming more unstable as opposed to less. 
Musharraf went on to play nuclear brinkmanship with India in 2002, risking war twice that year. 
Although Musharraf did turn against the Taliban after September 11, under extreme duress from the US, elements of his military continued to support radical Islamism and have recently been implicated in assassination attempts on Musharraf himself. 
This was the body that Bush proclaimed was bringing "stability" to the region in fall of 1999. 
So, one answer to Bush's charge about Edwards is that if it had any merit, Bush should have declined to run himself. 
Another answer is that Edwards certainly knows far more about foreign affairs now than Bush did then. 
Indeed, given how Bush has rampaged around the world alienating allies and ignoring vital conflicts with the potential to blow back on the US, one might well argue that Edwards knows more now than Bush does. 
This is what Edwards' campaign literature said about his positions: "Edwards believes that the U.S. must be an active leader to help resolve conflicts, from reducing tensions between India and Pakistan to the peace process in Northern Ireland. 
Edwards is a strong supporter of Israel, and believes that the U.S. has a vital role in promoting peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians." 
I don't see Bush doing any of this. 
From Friday's Daily Star 
By Juan Cole 
Friday, June 04, 2004 
As the American public gradually wearies of the Iraq crisis, some have begun worrying that the war could blow back on the US by creating the conditions for anti-American terrorism. 
Israel, however, is much closer to Iraq and is likely to suffer from Iraqi instability much more acutely than will the United States. 
Ironically, among the strongest proponents of war in Iraq were Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his neoconservative supporters in the US. 
Have they, however, actually weakened Israeli security? 
The biggest threat Israel faces is not from conventional armies but from the asymmetrical tactics of Palestinian national liberation movements. 
The derailing of the Oslo peace process by the hard-line policies of Sharon and the Palestinian intifada has encouraged suicide bombings. 
This, in turn, has discouraged international investment in Israel and has made it less likely that immigrants to the country will actually remain there. 
Although Israel withdrew from Lebanese territory in May 2000, the radical Lebanese Shiite party, Hizbullah, has not been mollified. 
It is estimated to have some 5,000 armed fighters, and they have pursued attacks against Israeli forces to compel them to withdraw from the Shebaa Farms, a sliver of Syrian territory that Israel annexed after the 1967 war. 
Any thorough assessment of the impact of the Iraq war and its aftermath on Israel's security environment must, therefore, closely examine its likely effect on the conduct of asymmetrical warfare. 
Although it is often alleged (without much evidence) that Saddam Hussein gave money to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers and so encouraged asymmetrical warfare, it is not clear that he actually posed a danger to Israel. 
The Palestinians who have been willing to kill themselves to end the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank were not driven by economic considerations. 
Saddam never did anything practical to help the Palestinians. 
At some points, as in the late 1980s, he reportedly made behind-the-scenes overtures to the Israelis to arrive at some sort of a deal. 
He did not allow Palestinian radicals to launch operations against Israel from Iraq. 
By the late 1990s, Iraq had no nuclear or biological weapons program, and had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpiles. 
Its ramshackle army had virtually collapsed before the American invasion in 2003. 
If it is hard to see how Baathist Iraq posed any real threat to Israel, it is not so difficult to see a menace in the current instability. 
The bungling of post-war Iraq by the Bush administration created a weak and failed state. 
Armed militias, many staffed by former Iraqi military men with substantial training and experience, have proliferated. 
The US chose to ally itself with such groups as the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, whose 15,000-strong Badr Corps paramilitary was trained by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards. 
Anti-Israeli and pro-Palestinian feeling is strong among several major Iraqi ideological groups and currents. 
The more radical Shiites, who generally follow the theocratic notions of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, routinely chant and demonstrate against Israel. 
They vehemently protested the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Hamas, last March. 
Worse for Israel, the assassination drew a denunciation even from the moderate and cautious Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, who wields enormous moral authority over Iraqi Shiites. 
These Shiite movements had been suppressed by Saddam Hussein's regime, but have now organized and armed themselves. 
They have also reestablished their historical links with Lebanese and Iranian Shiites. 
It is inevitable that most Iraqi Shiites will side with their Hizbullah coreligionists against Israel, and it seems likely that Iraqi Shiites will get rich enough from Iraqi petroleum sales in the future that they will be in a good position to bankroll Lebanese Shiite radicals. 
Sunni Arab fundamentalists deeply sympathize with the Palestinians and with Hamas, and those in Iraq have deep historical inks with fundamentalists in Jordan and Palestine. 
Iraqi cities such as Fallujah and Ramadi were on the truck route from Amman to Baghdad, and so came under the influence of the Salafi movement, which is popular in Jordan. 
Secular Arab nationalist groups also universally sympathize with the Palestinians, and those in post-Saddam Iraq are no exception. 
Whereas Saddam Hussein's dictatorship ensured that such populist currents were kept firmly under control, they are now free to organize. 
An Iraq in which armed fundamentalist and nationalist militias proliferate is inevitably a security worry for Israel. 
If even a modicum of normality and security can be returned to Iraq, its citizens will be able to benefit from the country's petroleum reserves. 
That private wealth can easily be funneled into aid for the Palestinians and for Lebanese Shiites. 
Israel's security interests are best served by peace with its neighbors, which can only be achieved by trading land for peace with the Palestinians. 
Ariel Sharon's aggressive near annexation of almost half of the occupied West Bank and his indefinite postponement of any Palestinian state have created unprecedented rage and violence. 
The anger has spread throughout the Muslim world, including Iraq. 
The promotion by the pro-Zionist right of twin occupations - in the West Bank and in Iraq - has profoundly weakened, not strengthened, Israeli security.

THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in agreement with Agence Global 
Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process 
But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making. 
And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka. 
Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987, the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty. 
India defensive over Sri Lanka 
By Ranjit Devraj 
NEW DELHI - 
While India is ready to enter into a "defense cooperation agreement" with Sri Lanka, it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation's two decades-old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60,000 dead on both sides. 
And that explains the delay in the signing of a formal defense agreement that was at the heart of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga's four-day visit to India recently. 
According to Professor S D Muni, South Asia expert at the Jawaharal Nehru University, the two-year peace talks between Colombo and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are stalemated. 
For that reason, he said, Kumaratunga's government was keen to beef up military preparedness with Indian support. 
"The Sri Lankan government does not want to initiate a conflict but would be interested in deterring the LTTE from starting one. 
And the Tigers look as if they are on the brink of launching another offensive," Muni told IPS. 
Colombo held six rounds of talks with the Tigers between September 2002 and March 2003. 
But last April, the rebels abruptly pulled out of negotiations demanding recognition, first, for the right to self-rule before proceeding any further. 
Kumaratunga's India tour preceded a three-day visit to Sri Lanka by Norwegian Foreign Minister Jan Petersen in a new bid to revive the peace talks that were supposed to follow a ceasefire that Oslo successfully brokered in February 2002. 
Petersen held discussions with both Kumaratunga and the reclusive LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran in the rebel stronghold of Kilinochchi without success, and chief Tamil rebel negotiator Anton Balasingham and Norwegian envoy Erik Solheim held closed-door talks at the international airport late Saturday in an effort to keep the salvage effort on track, diplomatic sources said. 
But they, too, failed. 
Colombo, too, seems to be in an intractable position. 
According to former Indian army general A S Kalkat, the difficulty for Kumaratunga's government lay in the fact that the LTTE had become a de jure power in the north and east of the island and was running every aspect of civil administration in the areas within its control. 
A veteran of India's military intervention in the Jaffna peninsula to help implement the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord - which ambitiously provided for the disarming of the formidable LTTE - Kalkat said the new defense deal would essentially be a reiteration of the older one minus its military commitment. 
Kalkat, who currently chairs the independent US-based International Council on Conflict Resolution, said despite the failure of the Indian army to disarm or even subdue the Tigers, India remained the only power capable of influencing the course of the current peace talks. 
"The Norwegians mean well but their role is limited to that of honest broker and the LTTE is keenly aware that they do not have the power [unlike India] to underwrite any arrangement," Kalkat told IPS in an interview. 
In 1987, the Tamil Tigers reluctantly accepted the peace accord under Indian pressure. 
Under the accord, a new northeastern provincial council was formed and the Indian army was deployed as peacekeepers in the north and east. 
However, differences between India and LTTE soon surfaced and led to clashes between Tiger guerrillas and the Indian peace keeping force. 
About 1,200 Indian soldiers were killed during this phase of the conflict. 
India had to pull back its forces from Sri Lanka in 1989 following the election of Ranasinghe Premadasa, a strong critic of Indian mediation. 
Last June, an international initiative led by Japan to persuade the LTTE to come back to the negotiating table failed despite an aid package offer of US$4.5 billion. 
Japan's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, who called for tangible progress in the peace process before the money would be released, came back from visits to Colombo and Kilinochchi in early November a frustrated man. 
He complained about the "visible lack of progress" and reaching an impasse in talks with both sides. 
The Tigers' chief ideologue, Balasingham, sniffed at the proposal saying that "a solution to the ethnic conflict cannot be predetermined by the resolutions or declarations of donor conferences, but has to be negotiated by the parties in conflict without the constraints of external forces." 
But there are strong hints in the country that a new Indo-Sri Lanka defense deal could be in the making. 
And this has already drawn protests from the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) which was backed by the LTTE in the April general elections held in Sri Lanka. 
"Tamils feel that the proposed defense agreement between India and Sri Lanka would encourage Sinhala rulers to prepare for another war abandoning the current peace process," TNA member of parliament P Sithamparanathan was quoted as saying in a statement. 
She added that recent visits to the island by India's top military brass including army chief General Nirmal Chander Vij have "caused apprehension among Tamils that preparations are under way for another war in the island". 
But Kalkat pointed out that India would be ill-advised to be involved again, militarily, with Sri Lanka if only because it still had to consider the sentiments of 45 million ethnic Tamils in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu - separated from Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula by the narrow Palk Straits. 
Apart from the 1,200 Indian lives lost in 1987, the Indian peacekeeping force was immensely unpopular not only in Tamil Nadu and the Jaffna peninsula but also among the Sinhalese majority who considered it a violation of their country's sovereignty. 
The best option, now, under the present difficult circumstances is for Colombo to do its own dirty work, although New Delhi can always be counted on to render good neighborly help because of the shared belief that religion, ethnicity and language cannot be the basis for secession. 
In any case, Kalkat puts it succinctly: "There cannot be a military option to what is a political situation." 
Asia Times Online 16/11/2004 
Unreported by the international media, the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded. 
Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed, with some used as building material and others as urinals. 
Thus far, none of the many "human rights" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development. 
Musharraf calls the bluff 
M.D. Nalapat 
While most U.S. secretaries of state -- save perhaps Dean Rusk -- have gobbled up credit for outcomes that they had little to do with, few have been as brazen as Colin Powell. 
Two years ago, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was surprised when the leader of the main Islamist alliance -- Maulana Fazlur Rahman -- visited India and issued a series of highly conciliatory statements. 
As Pakistan's president had been telling the United States he was "forced" into taking a hawkish line on India precisely by the likes of Rahman, this was an embarrassment. 
The reality is that India is no longer the enemy of choice for the people of Pakistan. 
That distinction has now gone to the United States. 
Realists, and this even includes members of the U.S. Democratic foreign policy establishment such as Strobe Talbott, who have long sought to divest India of its defensive capability against another nuclear power in Asia, understand the only feasible solution for Kashmir is the acceptance of the status quo. 
India keeps what it has while Pakistan and China (which was gifted a slice of the territory three decades ago) do likewise. 
Simultaneously, New Delhi would ensure a degree of autonomy for the state that would help cut popular support off from jihadis attempting to convert Kashmir into a second Afghanistan. 
Bill Clinton understood this at the end of his term in office yet, under Colin Powell (who appears to have an affinity for generals active in politics), the pendulum of U.S. policy has once again swung toward a quixotic effort to prize at least the Valley of Kashmir loose from India. 
This, Pakistan's lobbyist in Washington Christina Rocca has been told, is the "minimum" that the Pakistan army will accept. 
It is also far more than what any administration in New Delhi can deliver. 
This writer has for years regarded the best solution to the Kashmir problem as being the trifurcation of the Indian part of the state into a Hindu-majority Jammu, a Buddhist-dominated Ladakh and the overwhelmingly Muslim Kashmir Valley, with the third state given little of taxpayers' money but substantial autonomy. 
With luck, the Kashmir Valley can attract investment from the Middle East and other locations where Muslims are dominant and become a tourist, education and services haven within India. 
The overwhelming majority of Muslims in Kashmir would be happy with such an outcome, except for the tiny jihadi segment patronized by the U.S. State Department and the Pakistan Army, which would like to even the score with India for their catastrophic defeat in Bangladesh in 1971. 
Unreported by the international media, the Valley of Kashmir has seen an ethnic and cultural genocide that has resulted in the fleeing from the valley of almost all the Hindu families who have been living there since human habitation was first recorded. 
Over nine dozen temples that had served the Hindu population have been destroyed, with some used as building material and others as urinals. 
Thus far, none of the many "human rights" busybodies across the world have bothered to even notice such a development. 
Indeed, their reports are filled with tales of the "atrocities" of Indian troops on the innocent jihadis. 
Despite Sept. 11, the United States still supports the Kashmir groups that back jihad as part of the price Washington is paying to keep Pervez Musharraf happy. 
Unfortunately for them, the general has decided to take seriously Colin Powell's frequent boasts that it was on his nudging that the Indians made conciliatory gestures toward Islamabad. 
The U.S. State Department and the misnamed think tanks that follow its lead have held numerous conferences on Kashmir and, in most of them, the solution that has emerged is a valley prized loose from Indian control and under its own version of Ibrahim Rugova. 
That India is not Yugoslavia and that the "foreigner-led" Indian National Congress can least afford to ignore Indian nationalism, has not struck the conferees, among whom have been several Indian "scholars" and "analysts" ready to say and endorse anything for the sake of a free trip to New York or Vienna. 
Despite many wrinkles, India remains a part-democracy and merely signing on to a piece of paper that calls for an independent Kashmir does not get you into the trouble that writing an op-ed piece against Sonia Gandhi or Atal Behari Vajpayee would instantly. 
It was the business community in India that stepped in after Vajpayee indulged in an empty bout of saber rattling in 2002, pointing out that the only beneficiary of the mythical perception that war -- especially nuclear war -- was around the corner in the subcontinent was China. 
The reason for this is that India is emerging as an alternative investment destination to China, hence the favor that the generals in Islamabad do to their trusty supplier of nukes and missiles by creating a scare about war involving India when in fact the real flashpoints are the Taiwan Straits and North Korea. 
Since then, India has talked peace while always signaling that only the status quo would be acceptable as a final settlement: a line of action that is followed in the case of disputes with China as well. 
Unfortunately for those eager to indefinitely carry on with the lucrative business of conflict resolution in South Asia, Pervez Musharraf has now called Colin Powell's bluff, challenging him to deliver on his frequent statements implying that the Indians jump to his commands. 
Once the Manmohan Singh government shows that it has little appetite for suicide, Musharraf will face the moment of truth: accept the inevitable, or once again ramp up the insurgency and spawn a fresh lot of killers that can hit not merely Mumbai and New Delhi but London and Chicago as well. 
The one country that has shown that it understands the realities in South Asia is China. 
Under President Hu Jintao, Beijing has opened out to New Delhi and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is expected to visit early next year, making friends by formally accepting Sikkim as part of India and backing India as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council -- thus leaving Washington as the only one of the "permanent five" that has not yet done so. 
With Colin Powell around, the U.S. has no need of an Osama bin Laden

Washington Times 28/10/2004 
Ok. 
We all know that John Kerry served in Vietnam. 
Four whole months, after which he took advantage of a little-known, little-invoked regulation that allowed him to desert his "band of brothers". 
We also know how Dan Rather libeled George Bush and impugned his service in the Texas Air National Guard on a "60 Minutes II" report based largely on forged documents. 
During his time in the Guard, George Bush flew the F-102 Delta Dagger fighter-interceptor. 
The F-102 saw service in the Vietnam theater between March 1962 and December 1969. 
During this time, F-102 squadrons were based out of Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang and Bien Hoa in Vietnam, and Udorn and Don Muang in Thailand. 
( Click here for source. ) 
As far as George Bush knew, he and his unit could have been transferred to Vietnam. 
In all this so-called controversy, has anyone considered that perhaps George Bush just wanted to fly jets? 
And, let's remember, flying supersonic fighter jets is dangerous! 
They don't let just anybody do it. 
Some reporters (you know, the ones with journalistic ethics) have actually uncovered the truth about George Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard. 
For example, did you know that George Bush spent considerably more time in uniform than John Kerry? 
What follows is the text of an e-mail sent to me by a friend of mine (thanks to Dave Manzano). 
Read on to learn the facts. 
--------- 
Bush’s National Guard years 
Before you fall for Dems’ spin, here are the facts 
What do you really know about George W. Bush’s time in the Air National Guard? 
That he didn’t show up for duty in Alabama? 
That he missed a physical? 
That his daddy got him in? 
News coverage of the president’s years in the Guard has tended to focus on one brief portion of that time — to the exclusion of virtually everything else. 
So just for the record, here, in full, is what Bush did: 
The future president joined the Guard in May 1968. 
Almost immediately, he began an extended period of training. 
Six weeks of basic training. 
Fifty-three weeks of flight training. 
Twenty-one weeks of fighter-interceptor training. 
That was 80 weeks to begin with, and there were other training periods thrown in as well. 
It was full-time work. 
By the time it was over, Bush had served nearly two years. 
Not two years of weekends. 
Two years. 
After training, Bush kept flying, racking up hundreds of hours in F-102 jets. 
As he did, he accumulated points toward his National Guard service requirements. 
At the time, guardsmen were required to accumulate a minimum of 50 points to meet their yearly obligation. 
According to records released earlier this year, Bush earned 253 points in his first year, May 1968 to May 1969 (since he joined in May 1968, his service thereafter was measured on a May-to-May basis). 
Bush earned 340 points in 1969-1970. 
[In other words, Bush earned enough points to satisfy the requirements for his entire six year hitch in 1969-1970 alone. 
- acd] 
He earned 137 points in 1970-1971. 
And he earned 112 points in 1971-1972. 
The numbers indicate that in his first four years, Bush not only showed up, he showed up a lot. 
Did you know that? 
That brings the story to May 1972 — the time that has been the focus of so many news reports — when Bush “deserted” (according to anti-Bush filmmaker Michael Moore) or went “AWOL” (according to Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee). 
Bush asked for permission to go to Alabama to work on a Senate campaign. 
His superior officers said OK. 
Requests like that weren’t unusual, says retired Col. William Campenni, who flew with Bush in 1970 and 1971. 
“In 1972, there was an enormous glut of pilots,” Campenni says. 
“The Vietnam War was winding down, and the Air Force was putting pilots in desk jobs. 
In ’72 or ’73, if you were a pilot, active or Guard, and you had an obligation and wanted to get out, no problem. 
In fact, you were helping them solve their problem.” 
So Bush stopped flying. 
From May 1972 to May 1973, he earned just 56 points — not much, but enough to meet his requirement. 
Then, in 1973, as Bush made plans to leave the Guard and go to Harvard Business School, he again started showing up frequently. 
In June and July of 1973, he accumulated 56 points, enough to meet the minimum requirement for the 1973-1974 year. 
Then, at his request, he was given permission to go. 
Bush received an honorable discharge after serving five years, four months and five days of his original six-year commitment. 
By that time, however, he had accumulated enough points in each year to cover six years of service. 
During his service, Bush received high marks as a pilot. 
A 1970 evaluation said Bush “clearly stands out as a top notch fighter interceptor pilot” and was “a natural leader whom his contemporaries look to for leadership.” 
A 1971 evaluation called Bush “an exceptionally fine young officer and pilot” who “continually flies intercept missions with the unit to increase his proficiency even further.” 
And a 1972 evaluation called Bush “an exceptional fighter interceptor pilot and officer.” 
Now, it is only natural that news reports questioning Bush’s service — in The Boston Globe and The New York Times, on CBS and in other outlets — would come out now. 
Democrats are spitting mad over attacks on John Kerry’s record by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. 
And, as it is with Kerry, it’s reasonable to look at a candidate’s entire record, including his military service — or lack of it. 
Voters are perfectly able to decide whether it’s important or not in November. 
The Kerry camp blames Bush for the Swift boat veterans’ attack, but anyone who has spent much time talking to the Swifties gets the sense that they are doing it entirely for their own reasons. 
And it should be noted in passing that Kerry has personally questioned Bush’s service, while Bush has not personally questioned Kerry’s. 
In April — before the Swift boat veterans had said a word — Kerry said Bush “has yet to explain to America whether or not, and tell the truth, about whether he showed up for duty.” 
Earlier, Kerry said, “Just because you get an honorable discharge does not, in fact, answer that question.” 
Now, after the Swift boat episode, the spotlight has returned to Bush. 
That’s fine. 
We should know as much as we can. 
And perhaps someday Kerry will release more of his military records as well. 
Byron York is a White House correspondent for National Review. 
His column appears in The Hill each week. 
One week to elections day and the general atmosphere in the capital is eerie, yet strikingly familiar. 
I suspect the streets of Baghdad will look as if a war is looming this week. 
There is no doubt that many Iraqis regard the date of 30 January as a day of renewed hope, one they have been awaiting all their lives, but at the same time, many others are already dreading it. 
The interim government has promised security measures that would reduce the violence on the day of elections, but I fail to see how they will be able to protect all 5,000 (or so) balloting centres. 
Many voting centres have already been successfully attacked or destroyed in many areas. 
Now that the picture is clear, the two main competing lists seem to be the United Iraqi Coalition list and Allawi's Al-Iraqiya list. 
Ayad Allawi, and other ministers running on his list, have quite expectedly used their governmental positions in campaigning. 
One minister reportedly handed out 100 dollar 'gifts' to journalists attending a press conference for Allawi, a practice that brings back bad memories to many Iraqis. 
Sheikh Naji Al-Abbudi, a spokesman for Sistani, affirmed the claims that the Grand Ayatollah is backing the United Iraqi Coalition list. 
Indeed, Sistani's agents all over the country have been quite active in educating Iraqi Shia on the merits of elections, which has led to the assassination of at least two of them. 
Al-Abbudi stated that "His Emminence" decided to openly support the list because "others" (obviously a reference to Allawi) have been abusing official state positions and media outlets in their campaigning. 
Again there is no official written statement from Sistani's office confirming this allegation, which I think is intentional. 
Ahmed Al-Chalabi and defense minister Hazim Al-Sha'lan have been engaging in shrill public attacks over the media. 
Chalabi describing Sha'lan as a "Ba'athist" and a "former double agent for Saddam and the CIA", while Sha'lan dismisses Chalabi as a "thief" and an "Iranian stooge who longs for his own origins by defending Iran". 
One remark made by Sha'lan on Al-Arabiya TV, that he couldn't say more about Chalabi because he would embarrass himself and the viewers almost made me roll on the floor. 
It was an extremely amusing episode, watching Chalabi looking smug and amused, contrasted with Sha'lan, all serious and barely keeping himself from swearing. 
Fistfights, please. 
Hazim Al-Sha'lan, by the way, is the son of the late Sheikh of Al-Khaza'il in Diwaniya and has the potential to replace former information minister, M.S. Al-Sahaf, in his nonsensical media statements, which can be passed as jokes. 
The main Kurdish coalition list (PUK and KDP) is barely mentioned outside the Kurdish region. 
Even there, many Kurds look and act as if they are going to grab the chance to vote them out of power. 
I doubt that will be the outcome though. 
Many Iraqis, including conservative and religious Iraqis, are surprisingly rooting for the Iraqi Communist party, probably in an attempt to counter the influence of Islamists in the forthcoming National Assembly. 
The Communist party has the largest number of registered party members in the country and can be considered as the oldest popular political party in Iraq. 
Its support base is much larger than what it seems. 
*** 
Several candidates were assassinated and targeted these last two weeks, others have been forced under threats to withdraw and to follow the example of the Islamic party. 
Sectarian tensions are at their highest since April, 2004, with Sunni insurgents now openly attacking Husseiniyas and Shia mosques. 
I had an interesting conversation with a middle-aged taxi driver who used to live in Fallujah and is now at relatives in Amiriya, Baghdad. 
After asking me which tribe I belong to (thus assessing my sectarian background) he started hurling abuses at the Shia, calling them Persians, Majoos (fire worshippers), rabid dogs and a handful of other descriptions that I can't mention here. 
He described Allawi's face as that of a f*ed horse and he dismissed the whole government as a band of thieves and traitors. 
I didn't argue with him but I asked him what he believed would be a viable solution to this mess. 
He said that resistance was the only commonsense solution. 
First driving out the Americans, then fighting the Shia back into submission (as in 1991). 
Sunni Iraqis contend that elections are impossible to hold under occupation. 
Leaving aside the fact that this views conflicts with other historical examples in the region, Sunnis have never offered an alternative choice, which eventually leads one to guess that the opinion held by the Fallujan taxi driver above is precisely what they are planning to implement. 
I had another conversation some months ago with a retired Ba'athist old-timer who claimed that Ba'athists have the means to stage a third coup d'etat and return to power within 10 hours of an American withdrawal. 
On sensing my incredulity to his statement he asserted that Ba'athist cells exist in all parts of the country and that they do have a central command, even though many have formed seperate cells (often under Islamic labels) with their own leaderships. 
He said that they have the training and the funding as well as the support of neighbouring and regional governments. 
I concur that Ba'athists and former security forces are capable of immediately controlling at least 5 out of 18 governorates, along with the capital, if Americans are to be removed from the picture entirely. 
But I also see that as a fatal misconception, which is doing Sunnis harm, because I don't believe the US is going anywhere so soon. 
Any government that assumes power after the elections also realises this, so not even Sistani is going to call the US to withdraw its troops, despite what he is saying now, not until they are ensured the insurgency is out of the picture, or that they have an alternative foreign power (in this case Iran) to back them up. 
The only hope now is that, following the elections, the National Assembly would offer the hand of peace and reconciliation to the dissenting parties. 
I would suggest going for tribal Sheikhs rather than clerics, since they have the upper hand in their areas and can effectively root out any Ba'athists in their midst in return for a promise of sharing power and authority. 
Many of these Sheikhs have been disenfranchised and abused over the last two years. 
Very recently, US forces in Al-Anbar made a terrible blunder by accidentally killing Abdul-Razaq Inad Al-Gu'ud, Sheikh of the Al-Bu Nimr clan from the powerful Dulaym tribe. 
Al-Gu'ud had favoured elections and was in good terms with the government. 
The Gu'ud family even accepted to be offered the seat of Al-Anbar governor some months back. 
The Al-Bu Nimr in Ramadi and Al-Qaim rose in arms against Saddam in the mid-nineties following the execution of Thamir Madhlum Al-Dulaymi, an Air Force general belonging to their tribe. 
The revolt took two weeks to be suppressed by the Republican Guard. 
Another bad step was the recent arrest of Sheikh Hassan Al-Lihabi, of the Lihaib tribe which is scattered between the governorates of Al-Anbar, Mosul and Salah Al-Din. 
Al-Lihaibi was running in elections and is now said to have withdrawn following this incident. 
I believe national reconciliation to be the only path forward to a new Iraq. 
The Shia cannot live without the Sunnis, and vice versa. 
Both have shared this country for the last 14 centuries and there is no possible way that one can live without the other. 
Even partition is not a possibility, there are no clear borders between the two. 
Remember Luis Posada Carriles ? 
Here's a Miami Herald interview with the relaxed terrorist and former CIA operative in a luxury condo, published yesterday. 
("At first I hid a lot. 
I thought the US government was looking for me. 
Now I hide a lot less.") 
Because of such talk, Posada has been taken into custody by Immigration officials. 
I can't imagine they wanted to do this. 
Authorities would likely have been happy answering questions about Posada's whereabouts with an indefinite shrug. 
As recently as last week the official line stated they had no knowledge he had entered the country. 
But comfortable among the thugs, Posada overplayed his hand and embarrassed his old patron, the US government. 
And though he'd been a faithful servant, he was not such a player that he could get away with that. 
He should have taken a cue from another bomber some pesky dark-skinned foreigners want extradited, CIA operative Michael Meiring. 
Posada should have told any inquisitive journalist at his doorstep something like Meiring told the single American reporter who bothered following his bloody trail from the Philippines, that "If this harms me in any way, you will find my power then, and you'll find out who I am." 
But then, maybe that wouldn't have saved him either, because Posada is not Meiring. 
Posada can be given up, but Meiring can't. 
Meiring's crimes are fresh, and wave the false flag which is the "War on Terror." 
They happened in the Philippines which, like Pakistan, is an important and vulnerable node for the business which intelligence agencies and terrorist organizations conduct with each other. 
(Ask Terry Nichols about the Philippines.) 
The bombings implicated Muslims, and exacerbated regional tensions which the Bush regime and its friends wearing the brass in the Philippine military sought to exploit. 
Posada's crimes, on the other hand, must seem like ancient history, especially to a people who don't know their history. 
And to those who don't even know their crimes, not even that. 
But will Posada be given up? 
I doubt he will be extradited to Venezuela, which is the only way that question could be answered with a Yes. 
I expect it will be determined that, under "Strong Man" Hugo Chavez, Posada could not be guaranteed a fair trial. 
The hope may be that Posada can soon be offered to a post-Chavez Allawi-like puppet in Caracas. 
Whether such an offer were accepted or declined would make no difference; justice would not be served then. 
But Posada's nearly 80 years old, and the Venezuelan people will ensure that's a vain hope. 
So instead Posada may be held indefinitely, in comfortable custody. 
An embarrassment to the US still, just not as embarrassing as having the old killer strut about Miami, gloating in his freedom. 
Meiring is more than an embarrassment. 
His case threatens the consensus fiction of the "War on Terror." 
So his name will remain unspoken. 
Another connection to Philippine terror and weapons smuggling- dating from the 1980s- is alleged in the book Disposable Patriot, by Jack Terrell. 
Terrell, a CIA asset originally recruited for the Contra effort, identifies the man attempting to recruit him into the Philippine scheme as Oliver North...
I seem to recall the object was to smuggle explosives. 
http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/0915765381/701-3377456-8181939 
I've read the book- it's a first person memoir with the ring of truth, especially since so much of the wider context has confirmed the allegations of Contra drug connections that led to Terrell becoming a target for discrediting by the TWIG counterintelligence group that ran interference for the Contra effort, staffed by covert ops types including Ollie North, Robert Owen, Vince Cannistaro and Buck Revell. 
Peter Dale Scott includes an account of how Terrell's whistleblowing was stifled by them in his book Cocaine Politics. 
... same ole, same ole... 
Due to the Judge in the 1983 case ruling that a CIA agent could not testify using a pseudonym, therefore opening him to cross-examination by Wilson, the prosecution had a problem. 
They needed someone that could convince the jury they had been able to see all relevant documents in CIA files on Wilson. 
Wilson was claiming that he had been working for the CIA when he sold the C-4 to Quaddaffi. 
The prosecution was charging he was a rogue using his contacts from former service in both CIA and the 'Office of Naval Intelligence'. 
Wilson had been able to show that he'd had more than 80 "non-social contacts" with the CIA since his retirement in 1971, leaving the prosecution's case in turmoil. 
Then Charles A. Briggs came to the rescue. 
Third ranking CIA officer, Briggs signed a declaration on February 3rd, 1983, that on November 8th, 1982, he had authorized a search of CIA records "for any material that in any way pertains to Edwin P. Wilson, or the various allegations concerning his activities after February 28th, 1971, when he retired from the CIA." 
The Briggs Declaration states that with one exception in 1972, Wilson did not work "directly or indirectly" for the CIA since retiring. 
http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id334/pg1/ 
Last week, Federal District Judge Lynn Hughes in Huston, Texas, threw out Wilson's two-decades old conviction. 
Judge Hughes wrote: `government knowingly used false evidence against him,' concluding `honesty comes hard to government.'

Former Pastor, Deputy Implicated In Church Child Sex Abuse 
PONCHATOULA, La. -- 
Sheriff's deputies in Louisiana made a third arrest Wednesday in the ongoing investigation of a case involving allegations of sexual abuse of children and animals at a Ponchatoula, La., church. 
Austin Aaron Bernard III, 36, was arrested on a charge of aggravated rape of a child under the age of 13. 
Police said Bernard confessed to detectives that he had sex with a young girl in November 2002 and admitted to knowing about sexual acts involving children and a dog that occurred at Hosanna Church. 
Tangipahoa Parish sheriff's deputy Christopher Blair Labat, 24, was booked Tuesday on one count of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature. 
On Monday, Louis Lamonica, 45, the former pastor of Hosanna Church, was booked with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of crime against nature after he walked in to the Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office and said he could implicate others in a situation at the church that reportedly occurred two years ago. 
We have a similar case unravelling up here in the northwest with a murder of a family and missing children taken for some purpose. 
If I was Rummy I'd send Posada to Iraq to blow things up there. 
yeah, "things"... 
Yesterday evening, the Posada story was featured in the public television news show in Germany (ARD, Tagesthemen). 
The newly released papers, showing him complicit in the airliner bombing, were mentioned

+ As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in, Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny. 
In recent months, its fallibility has become evident. 
The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro-India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka, and the recent "coup" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy, are glaring examples of intelligence failure. + 
Trouble on India's islands 
Ramtanu Maitra 
In early February, India charged 34 Arakan separatists from Myanmar with hiding in the Landfall Islands, part of the Andaman Islands group (see end note). 
These alleged members of the Arakan Army, the military wing of the National Unity Party in Myanmar, have been charged with illegal entry. 
It is likely, but not certain, that they will be deported to Myanmar. 
But the news of the Arakan rebels is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to growing concern in New Delhi over the security of the Andaman Islands. 
Reports are circulating in the intelligence community that the Andaman Islands are not only thick with Myanmar rebels. 
It has also become an arms depot of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who operate almost freely in the Andaman Sea. 
Information pointing in this direction came to light after the December 26 tsunami, which took a heavy toll on the Andamans. 
Correspondents who flocked in to cover the tsunami found they also had another story - the miserable security situation surrounding the Indian navy's Far Eastern Naval Command, now being established along with India's "blue water navy". 
Deteriorating security 
Security problems in the Andaman Sea are not new, but they have deteriorated during the past few years, in tandem with a deterioration in the security situation in Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, and particularly in the northeastern Indian states of Manipur, Nagaland and Tripura. 
While the Indian army has become rock-solid in the western front, and has developed the capability of withstanding any Pakistani adventure in that sector, it has become highly vulnerable in its eastern sector, where its enemy is not a national army but a multitude of secessionist, terrorist and drug-running militants operating between Southeast Asia and northeastern India through Bangladesh. 
The Andaman Sea is a major conduit for this traffic, and the 572 large and small islands that constitute the Andaman and Nicobar group are a natural transit base. 
The drugs and arms travel in all directions. 
Since the "Sea Tigers" of the LTTE, better known as the Tamil Tigers, are the ones who rule the Andaman Sea: they carry the arms and drugs for their own use and also to deliver to rebels in Aceh and all along the east coast of Africa. 
It is old news that the Tamil Tigers have developed a strong network within South Africa. 
This is not unknown to New Delhi. 
A recent report by a journalist from Port Blair, in the Andamans, quoted an unnamed official saying that foreigners from Myanmar, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have permanently settled in the islands, using fake Indian ration cards, while citizens of Thailand, China, Indonesia and Malaysia have migrated temporarily to plunder the natural resources and leave. 
"Port Blair, Havelock Islands, Diglipur, Middle Nicobar, Campbell's Bay, Neil Islands and Rangott are mostly overrun by foreigners," he said. 
An official estimate issued in 2003 suggests there are 50,000 "foreigners" in the Andaman Islands, but unofficial figures are much higher than this. 
A large number of them are Bangladeshis, who like millions of their countrymen have left their densely populated homeland to settle elsewhere. 
As most of them have few technical skills, and the Andamans have little demand for them in any case, they turn to smuggling and other unlawful activities. 
The presence of the Sea Tigers in the area with guns, cash and drugs makes the situation extremely dangerous. 
Reports from Port Blair make it evident that New Delhi gets little on-the-ground intelligence, and the Indian Coast Guard is grossly unequipped to deal with the surge of illegal migrants to the islands. 
One unnamed naval officer was quoted saying, "Arms smuggling is a very profitable business in this region." 
Considering the islands' huge strategic importance, it is amazing how lax New Delhi has been. 
These islands sit aside the vital sea lanes of the Strait of Malacca, through which 300 tankers and merchant ships pass daily, bringing in oil for the Far East and Southeast Asia. 
Intelligence lapses 
As the implications of the Andaman Islands situation sink in, Indian intelligence has inevitably come under scrutiny. 
In recent months, its fallibility has become evident. 
The inability to foresee in advance the assassination attempt on the pro-India political leader and former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina Wazed last August 21 at a political rally in Dhaka, and the recent "coup" by Nepalese King Gyanendra dismissing his government and imposing a virtual absolute monarchy, are glaring examples of intelligence failure. 
With growing economic and military power, India will be dependent on smaller nations in the region increasingly to maintain regional security. 
Unless New Delhi does better in providing security to its own nationals against rebels, secessionists, drug runners and arms traffickers, it will not generate much confidence in the capitals of surrounding nations. 
In fact, it would tend to encourage more organized anti-India outfits, such as the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and outside-linked Maoists, to exploit these networks and weaken India's eastern flank. 
Indian intelligence's lackluster performance in dealing with the LTTE is startling. 
This formidable enemy, which gave the Indian army a black eye in the mid-1980s, has been operating in northeastern India and in the Andaman Sea for a long time. 
In 2001, according to Indian army officials, security forces launched a wide-ranging operation in the 300-some inhabited islands neighboring Andaman and Nicobar, and found huge caches of arms. 
The arms were said to belong to the LTTE and "other terrorist groups". 
The search-and-destroy operation was carried out by the Indian government after repeated requests from Colombo. 
In addition, LTTE activity in the Andaman Sea is well known to local observers. 
The biggest LTTE maritime disaster was reported in the now-defunct Asiaweek in 2001. 
A shipment of weapons, ammunition and explosives, believed to have been purchased from Cambodia and worth several million dollars, left the port of Phuket in Thailand in early February 2001 aboard the freighter Comex-Joux 3. 
As is LTTE standard procedure, the vessel changed its name at sea to Horizon. 
On its journey across the Bay of Bengal the freighter was tracked by the Indian navy and Orissa-based spy planes of India's Aviation Research Center; it was intercepted by Indian naval vessels off Sri Lanka's east coast. 
LTTE arms-running 
In 1997, the Thai navy reported the interception of a 16-meter boat after a chase off the Thai port of Ranong, and the confiscation of two tons of weapons and ammunition. 
Among the weapons intercepted were two rocket-propelled-grenade launchers, 20 assault rifles, M-79 grenade launchers and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition. 
Four persons were arrested, reportedly belonging to the Manipur Revolutionary People's Front. 
Six crew members were from the Arakan region of Myanmar. 
The boat was heading toward Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh. 
Until 1995 the LTTE maintained a base at Twante, an island off the coat of Myanmar, west of the Andaman islands. 
Subsequently, Phuket became the LTTE's main backup base. 
A Sri Lanka-born Tamil with a Norwegian passport was arrested by Thai authorities in 2000 for his links with the LTTE. 
At the time of his arrest, the suspect was allegedly involved in constructing a "submarine" in a shipyard on the island of Sirae near Phuket on the Andaman Sea coast. 
Steady buildup 
The real threat to the Andaman Islands is the steady building-up of ports and conduits that serve the Tamil Tigers and a host of less-strong militant groups. 
Over the past decade, Bangladesh has steadily moved into a state of lawlessness. 
A number of extremist groups, under the cover of the Islamist movement, have become active in drug trafficking, gun running and anti-Indian activities. 
It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistani ISI has nurtured a number of extremist Islamist groups, such as the Harkat-ul-Jehad-al-Islami, in the port city of Chittagong, and put a number of secessionist rebels from India's northeast in touch with this terrorist network. 
As a result, north of the Andaman Islands, Bangladeshi coastal areas have become a nest of terrorists involved in the shipment of drugs and arms. 
A pattern of arrests and seizures indicate that arms are brought by the LTTE from Laos, Cambodia and Thailand into Chittagong, from where they are transported northward by land to Bhutan. 
The route from Kalikhola in Bhutan to Cox's Bazar passes through northern Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya, and on into Chittagong. 
Note 
India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands comprise more than 500 islands lying 1,000 kilometers east of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. 
Stretching 750 kilometers from end to end, they reach from near the coast of Myanmar almost to Sumatra in Indonesia. 
The Ten Degree Channel divides the Andamans, which are the larger and more heavily populated northern islands, from the 20 or so Nicobar Islands in the south. 
On South Andaman, the most heavily populated island, is Port Blair, which is the capital and the only large town in the entire archipelago. 
Travel to the Nicobar Islands is forbidden to non-Indians, and they are also not allowed in some parts of South Andaman Island.

“There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan,’’ says a Pakistani official.

Karzai, Musharraf new regional equations 
KABUL: 
For the past 25 years landlocked Afghanistan has suffered from constant interference from its neighbours - Pakistan, Iran and the Central Asian Republics - and regional powers -Russia and India. 
The neighbours are still interfering, but there are signs that rather than undermining Afghanistan’s stability they may now be trying to strengthen it. 
“The elections should be a reassurance to all our neighbours that a stable Afghanistan, a peaceful Afghanistan is good for all. 
Nobody should feel a looser in Afghanistan,’’ President Hamid Karzai told Pakistan’s English daily The Nation. 
All the regional countries have publicly backed the Karzai government and supported the electoral process, but serious undercurrents remain as they all have their favourite contenders in Afghanistan. 
Since September 11, Pakistan has been repeatedly accused by Afghan and Western leaders of harbouring Taliban extremists who had pledged to disrupt the elections, but at the highest level the US has avoided criticising President Pervaiz Musharraf on the grounds that he is helping the US catch Al Qaeda elements inside Pakistan. 
That changed on September 22 when President George W. Bush, Musharraf and Karzai held a three way meeting in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. 
The meeting was pushed together by the CIA and the US Defence Department who were desperately anxious to secure a peaceful election in Afghanistan and the non-interference of alleged Pakistani backed Taliban. 
Western and Afghan diplomats intimately involved with the meeting, said Bush pushed Musharraf hard on reigning in the Taliban so the elections could take place peacefully. 
‘’Where are Mullah Omar, Mullah Usmani and Gulbuddin Hikmetar?’’ 
Bush is reported to have asked a flustered Musharraf. 
All three are extremist Taliban or their allies and known to be living in Pakistan. 
(Mullah Omar is leader of the Taliban, Usmani is the former corps commander of Kandahar under the Taliban regime and now a commander of Taliban forces while Hikmetyar heads the extremist Hizb-e-Islami.) 
‘’It was the first time that Bush totally focused on the Taliban threat rather than Al Qaeda with the Pakistanis,’’ says a Western diplomat. 
‘’Bush was very well briefed before the meeting,’’ the diplomat said. 
An Afghan official at the meeting added, ‘’The Americans now realise that the Taliban are a bigger threat to our security than Al Qaeda.’’ 
Karzai was clearly pleased at the results. 
‘’President Musharraf promised to help us and cooperate with us on curbing terrorist activity by the Taliban,’’ says Karzai. 
The next day an angry Musharraf categorically said that Pakistan would not send Pakistani troops to Iraq, a clear snub to the Americans. 
Until then he had said Pakistan’s options were open. 
However Pakistani officials insist that the decision was unconnected to the tripartite meeting. 
US and NATO military officers in Kabul say it is too early to say whether Bush’s tough message was instrumental in persuading Musharraf and the ISI to pressure the Taliban to restrain from disrupting the elections. 
However there were visible signs of a crackdown on the Pakistan side. 
‘’Pakistan now has a large force deployed in Baluchistan which was not there before,’’ says Lt. General David Barno. 
‘’There is much better tactical cooperation between our forces on both sides of the border, but the movement of Taliban still goes on both ways,’’ he adds. 
Also several days before the elections Pakistan closed the border crossing point at Chaman in Baluchistan which is a key entry point for the Taliban into Afghanistan. 
However US military officers say regular army officers - many of them Pashtun - leading units of the Frontier Corps who are on the border remain deeply sympathetic to the Taliban and the mullahs of the JUI. 
At the same time the US remains oblivious of the serious problems and political fallout which the army is facing in its operations in Waziristan. 
Not only is the army facing serious political fallout, growing anti-Americanism and anti-army feeling in the tribal areas but it is also taking heavy casualties -between 400-500 Pakistani soldiers have been killed in the region since March. 
Musharraf has always maintained that the US has never provided actionable intelligence about Taliban leaders hiding in Baluchistan. 
That too may change. 
US and Afghan intelligence will shortly be presenting the ISI with a list of Taliban extremists and their suspected whereabouts. 
Moreover there are now major covert attempts under way to try and bring back to Kabul leading Taliban commanders, who have been living quietly in Pakistan and have taken no part in the Taliban insurgency. 
With the Taliban failure to disrupt the Afghan elections, the militants are even more isolated from the mainstream Taliban who want to return home. 
Until now Pakistan has not facilitated such a return and clearly it cannot happen until there is both a pull from Kabul and a push from Islamabad. 
With President Karzai certain to win the elections and the demotion of key former Northern Alliance figures such as General Fahim and warlord Ismail Khan, there is now little reason for moderate Taliban leaders to fear reprisals from former Northern Alliance figures if they return home. 
Their removal should also provide increased motivation for Pakistan to help the return of moderate Taliban. 
Afghan officials welcomed the appointment on October 3 of Lt. General Ashfaq Kiyani as the new ISI chief. 
Kayani is well known and liked in Kabul as during the last year he led the Pakistani delegation in the tripartite military meetings with the Afghan and US military on issues related to border issues. 
Karzai also has to deal with the stepped up rivalry between India and Pakistan in Afghanistan. 
Islamabad accuses New Delhi of using its consulates in Kandahar and Jalalabad to train Balochi insurgents who are active in Pakistani Balochistan. 
Pakistani officials claim there are as many as 42 RAW agents based in Kandahar and another 12 in Jalalabad. 
“There have no business being there unless they are undermining Pakistan,’’ says a Pakistani official. 
Both India and Afghanistan deny the claim. 
‘’Should Pakistan show us any evidence of an Indian hand using Afghan soil to work against our neighbours we will take it very seriously,” says Amrullah Saleh the head of Afghanistan’s National Security Directorate. 
Karzai categorically said that he has assured Musharraf repeatedly that any adverse action against Pakistan taken by Indian diplomats inside Afghanistan would be acted upon swiftly. 
Senior US diplomats and military officials have warned India also. 
In a major regional shift reflecting the newly strengthened position of Karzai, Iran, Russia and India which have traditionally backed the Tajik dominated former Northern Alliance made strenuous efforts to convince presidential candidate Younis Qanooni to strike a deal with Karzai before the elections and not to oppose Karzai. 
Iran in particular feared that Qanooni would loose and then be politically isolated from the mainstream. 
Qanooni refused to accept the Iranian advice as his fellow Panjsheri Tajiks urged him to stand against Karzai. 
However since the elections Iranian influence has proved critical in convincing the Hazara Shia candidate Mohammed Mohaqeq to accept the results of the elections and later convincing Qanooni to do the same. 
With the US military presence posing a threat on their borders in both Iraq and Afghanistan, Iran’s moderate leadership is keen to help stabilise Karzai so that the US presence in Afghanistan is reduced. 
However powerful hardliners in Tehran may be trying to undermine that strategy and a new issue is likely to deepen the rift with the moderates. 
Iranian officials are deeply concerned about the US occupation of Shindand, a massive Soviet-era airbase just 30 kilometres from Iran’s border. 
The enhanced US presence in western Afghanistan was only made possible after the ousting of Ismail Khan, the warlord and Governor of Herat province last month, who was a close ally of Iranian hardliners. 
Iranian officials say they made no objections to Khan’s ouster because they want to strengthen Karzai’s campaign against warlords. 
At a time of heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington over Iran’s nuclear weapons program and calls by neo-conservatives in Washington that a second Bush term should deal with Iran aggressively, the Iranians fear that Shindand could be used as a listening post, spying facility and even a launching pad for any future US actions against Iran. 
Afghan officials say the Americans have moved over 100 Special Forces and helicopters to Shindand. 
However General Barno insists the US presence poses no threat to Iran. 
‘’We have a very small number of forces in Shindand with a few helicopters,’’ says Barno. 
Nevertheless this places Karzai in a difficult and sensitive situation because he has to maintain excellent relations with both the US and Iran. 
‘’Afghanistan has had the benefit of cooperation from both the US and Iran. 
So far what they have done together has been good for us and that’s how we would like to keep it’’, says Karzai. 
Nobody can claim that the interference of Afghanistan’s neighbours is over, but the elections will do much to strengthen Karzai and deal more firmly with neighbours’ interference. 
In the post election scenario it is becoming abundantly clear that the Taliban do not have the support of the Afghan people nor the Afghan Pashtuns. 
In a highly significant move Afghan Pashtun tribes along the Pakistan border warned the Taliban in Quetta and Chaman that if they try and disrupt the elections, they would be resisted. 
Many Taliban living in Afghanistan voted for President Karzai. 
It is now abundantly clear that with the rapidly changing face of Afghanistan, the demise of key Northern Alliance figures and the fluid political situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan should reconsider its policy of giving unlimited sanctuary to Taliban extremists living on Pakistani soil. 
Pakistan Link 16/10/2004 
The debate that a handful of Texas multi-millionnaires close to the Bush family have cleverly manufactured over John Kerry's war record is absurd in every way. 
The charges that they have put some vets up to making against Kerry are false and can be demonstrated by the historical record to be false . 
Most of those making the charges have even flip-flopped, contradicting themselves. 
Or they weren't eyewitnesses and are just lying. 
But to address the substance of this Big Lie is to risk falling into its logic. 
The true absurdity of the entire situation is easily appreciated when we consider that George W. Bush never showed any bravery at all at any point in his life. 
He has never lived in a war zone. 
If some of John Kerry's wounds were superficial, Bush received no wounds. 
(And, a piece of shrapnel in the forearm that caused only a minor wound would have killed had it hit an eye and gone into the brain; the shrapnel being in your body demonstrates you were in mortal danger and didn't absent yourself from it. 
That is the logic of the medal). 
Kerry saved a man's life while under fire. 
Bush did no such thing. 
What was Bush doing with his youth? 
He was drinking. 
He was drinking like a fish, every night, into the wee hours. 
For decades. 
He gave no service to anyone, risked nothing, and did not even slack off efficiently. 
The history of alcoholism and possibly other drug use is a key issue because it not only speaks to Bush's character as an addictive personality, but may tell us something about his erratic and alarming actions as president. 
His explosive temper probably provoked the disastrous siege of Fallujah last spring, killing 600 Iraqis, most of them women and children, in revenge for the deaths of 4 civilian mercenaries, one of them a South African. 
(Newsweek reported that Bush commanded his cabinet, "Let heads roll!") 
That temper is only one problem. 
Bush has a sadistic streak. 
He clearly enjoyed, as governor, watching executions. 
His delight in killing people became a campaign issue in 2000 when he seemed, in one debate, to enjoy the prospect of executing wrong-doers a little too much. 
He has clearly gone on enjoying killing people on a large scale in Iraq. 
Drug abuse can affect the ability of the person to feel deep emotions like empathy. 
Two decades of pickling his nervous system in various highly toxic substances have left Bush damaged goods. 
Even for those who later abstain, "visual-spatial abilities, abstraction, problem solving , and short-term memory, are the slowest to recover." 
That he managed to get on the wagon (though with that pretzel incident, you wonder how firmly) is laudable. 
But he suffers the severe effects of the aftermath, and we are all suffering along with him now, since he is the most powerful man in the world. 
We all know by now that Bush did not even do his full service with the Texas Air National Guard, absenting himself to work on the Alabama senate campaign of Winton "Red" Blount. 
Whether he was actually AWOL during this stint is unclear. 
But it is clear that not only did Bush slack off on his National Guard service, but he slacked off from his campaign work. 
This little-noted interview with Blount's nephew Murph Archibald, which appeared on National Public Radio's "All Things Considered on March 30, 2004, gives a devastating insight into what it was like to have to suffer through Bush in that period. 
"All Things Considered (8:00 PM ET) - NPR March 30, 2004 Tuesday 
This campaign season, there have been questions about whether George W. Bush fulfilled his obligations to the National Guard as a young lieutenant in the early 1970s. 
For weeks, reporters scoured Alabama in search of pilots or anyone who might have remembered seeing Mr. Bush at the time he was serving in the National Guard there. 
There is one place in Alabama where Mr. Bush was present nearly every day: the headquarters in Montgomery of US Senate candidate Winton "Red" Blount. 
President Bush has always said that working for Blount was the reason he transferred to the Alabama Air National Guard. 
NPR's Wade Goodwyn has this report about Mr. Bush's time on that campaign. 
WADE GOODWYN reporting: 
In 1972, Baba Groom was a smart, funny young woman smack-dab in the middle of an exciting US Senate campaign. 
Groom was Republican Red Blount's scheduler, and in that job, she was the hub in the campaign wheel. 
Ask her about the handsome young man from Texas, and she remembers him 32 years later like it was yesterday. 
Ms. BABA GROOM (Former Campaign Worker): 
He would wear khaki trousers and some old jacket. 
He was always ready to go out on the road. 
On the phone, you could hear his accent. 
It was a Texas accent. 
But he just melded with everybody. 
GOODWYN: The candidate Mr. Bush was working for, Red Blount, had gotten rich in Alabama in the construction business. 
Prominent Southern Republicans were something of a rare breed in those days. 
Blount's support of the party led him to be appointed Richard Nixon's postmaster general. 
In Washington, Blount became friends and tennis partners with Mr. Bush's father, then Congressman Bush. 
That was how 26-year-old Lieutenant Bush came to Montgomery, at his father's urging . . . 
It was Mr. Bush's job to organize the Republican county chairpersons in the 67 Alabama counties. 
Back in 1972 in the Deep South, many rural counties didn't have much in the way of official Republican Party apparatus. 
But throughout Alabama, there were Republicans and Democrats who wanted to help Red Blount. 
It was the young Texan's job to find out what each county leader needed in the way of campaign supplies and get those supplies to them. 
Groom says this job helped Mr. Bush understand how even in a statewide Senate campaign, politics are local. 
. . . Murph Archibald is Red Blount's nephew by marriage, and in 1972, he was coming off a 15-month tour in Vietnam in the infantry. 
Archibald says that in a campaign full of dedicated workers, Mr. Bush was not one of them. 
Mr. MURPH ARCHIBALD (Nephew of Red Blount): Well, I was coming in early in the morning and leaving in mid-evenings. 
Ordinarily, George would come in around noon; he would ordinarily leave around 5:30 or 6:00 in the evening. 
GOODWYN: Archibald says that two months before the election, in September of '72, Red Blount's campaign manager came to him and asked that he quietly take over Mr. Bush's job because the campaign materials were not getting out to the counties. 
Mr. ARCHIBALD: George certainly didn't seem to have any concerns about my taking over this work with the campaign workers there. 
My overall impression was that he didn't seem as interested in the campaign as the other people who were working at the state headquarters. 
GOODWYN: Murph Archibald says that at first, he didn't know that Mr. Bush was serving in the Air National Guard. 
After he found out from somebody else, Archibald attempted to talk to Mr. Bush about it. 
The president was a lieutenant and Archibald had been a lieutenant, too; he figured they had something to talk about. 
Mr. ARCHIBALD: George didn't have any interest at all in talking about the military. 
In fact, when I broached the subject with him, he simply changed the subject. 
He wasn't unpleasant about it, but he just changed the subject and wouldn't talk about it. 
GOODWYN: Far from Texas and Washington, DC, Mr. Bush enjoyed his freedom. 
He dated a beautiful young woman working on the campaign. 
He went out in the evenings and had a good time. 
In fact, he left the house he rented in such disrepair--with damage to the walls and a chandelier destroyed--that the Montgomery family who owned it still grumble about the unpaid repair bill. 
Archibald says Mr. Bush would come into the office and, in a friendly way, offer up stories about the drinking he'd done the night before, kind of as a conversation starter. 
Mr. ARCHIBALD: People have different ways of starting the days in any office. 
They're going to talk about their kids, they're going to talk about football, they're going to talk about the weather. 
And this was simply his opening gambit; he would start talking about that he had been out late the night before drinking. 
GOODWYN: Archibald says the frequency with which Mr. Bush discussed the subject was off-putting to him. 
Mr. ARCHIBALD: I mean, at that time, I was 28; George would have been 25 or 26. 
And I thought it was really unusual that someone in their mid-20s would initiate conversations, particularly in the context of something as serious as a US senatorial campaign, by talking about their drinking the night before. 
I thought it unusual and, frankly, inappropriate. 
GOODWYN: According to Archibald, Mr. Bush would also sometimes tell stories about his days at Yale in New Haven, and how whenever he got pulled over for erratic driving, he was let go after the officers discovered he was the grandson of a Connecticut US senator. 
Archibald, a middle-class Alabama boy--who, by the way, is now a registered Democrat--didn't like that story. 
Mr. ARCHIBALD: He told us whenever he was stopped, as soon as the law enforcement found out that he was the grandson of Prescott Bush, they would let him go. 
And he would always laugh about that. " 
Goodwyn dutifully notes that Baba Groom didn't remember George telling drunk stories. 
But that means nothing, since they weren't the sort of things guys like Bush told the "girls". 
He was trying to buddy with Archibald and impress him. 
Again, decades of this sort of behavior do not leave a person untouched. 
Our world is in crisis and our Republic is in danger. 
It should not be left in the hands of a man who spent his life like this.

Afraid I don't have time today to discuss these, but some stories need attention: 
From Wednesday's Mirror the headline, "Have 200,000 AK47s Fallen Into the Hands of Iraq Terrorists?" 
(also see this thread on the RI discussion board): 
Some 200,000 guns the US sent to Iraqi security forces may have been smuggled to terrorists, it was feared yesterday. 
The 99-tonne cache of AK47s was to have been secretly flown out from a US base in Bosnia. 
But the four planeloads of arms have vanished. 
Orders for the deal to go ahead were given by the US Department of Defense. 
But the work was contracted out via a complex web of private arms traders . 
And the Moldovan airline used to transport the shipment was blasted by the UN in 2003 for smuggling arms to Liberia, human rights group Amnesty has discovered. 
It follows a separate probe claiming that thousands of guns meant for Iraq's police and army instead went to al-Qaeda . 
Amnesty chief spokesman Mike Blakemore said: "It's unbelievable that no one can account for 200,000 assault rifles. 
If these weapons have gone missing it's a terrifying prospect." 
American defence chiefs hired a US firm to take the guns, from the 90s Bosnian war, to Iraq. 
But air traffic controllers in Baghdad have no record of the flights, which supposedly took off between July 2004 and July 2005. 
A coalition forces spokesman confirmed they had not received "any weapons from Bosnia" and added they were "not aware of any purchases for Iraq from Bosnia". 
Nato and US officials have already voiced fears that Bosnian arms - sold by US, British and Swiss firms - are being passed to insurgents. 
A NATO spokesman said: "There's no tracking mechanism to ensure they don't fall into the wrong hands. 
There are concerns that some may have been siphoned off." 
This year a newspaper claimed two UK firms were involved in a deal in which thousands of guns for Iraqi forces were re-routed to al-Qaeda. 
The Moldovan airline is Aerocom, and yes , it's one of Victor Bout's . 
It's always a bang-your-head-against-the-wall moment, reading again the play the incompetence theory receives, even from some of the Administration's harshest mainstream critics. 
But then, even to talk of an "administration" may be misdirection at this point, given how little representative government means in the United States these days, and how much of "national security" has been privatized into a global gangland of drugs and guns. 
Like the tens of billions of dollars that have been "lost" in Iraq, planeloads of arms don't just "vanish"; not when the Pentagon contracts the work to an international criminal of Bout's untouchable stature. 
But Bout's name isn't likely to be mentioned in whatever coverage this story receives, before it sinks like so many others beneath the media's frothing triviality. 
Meanwhile, a decision's been reached in the trial of Toledo priest Gerald Robinson. 
And it's guilty : 
The Rev. Gerald Robinson appeared stony-faced as the jury's guilty verdict was read, and he blinked repeatedly and glanced at his lawyers before being led away in handcuffs. 
... 
The crime occurred in the sacristy adjoining the hospital chapel in downtown Toledo on the Saturday before Easter in 1980. 
Investigators said the nun, Margaret Ann Pahl, 71, was strangled and then stabbed, with nine wounds on her chest forming the shape of an inverted cross, a well-recognized Satanic symbol. 
An altar cloth was draped over her half-naked body, which was posed as if she had been sexually assaulted. 
"It was about how he could humiliate her the most," prosecutor Dean Mandros said in closing arguments. 
"He left a message for everyone to see ... maybe to God himself." 
After the sentencing one of Robinson's tearful supporters "turned to Claudia Vercellotti, a local leader of the Survivors Network for Those Abused by Priests [SNAP], who had helped reopen the case, and told her, 'I hope you rot in hell!'" 
From SNAP's statement on the Robinson conviction: 
More than ever, police and prosecutors have the tools and the will to go after horrific crimes, even when the defendants are seemingly powerful individuals or institutions . 
When victims and witnesses stay silent, nothing changes. 
When victims and witnesses speak up, at least sometimes a child is protected, the truth is exposed, and justice is done. 
The murder weapon, Robinson's letter opener: 
Finally, from an email, a follow-up on the reopening of the investigation into the Atlanta Child Murders : 
Dekalb County Police Chief Louis Graham...the man who reopened the investigations last year, is mysteriously stepping down. 
And of all the people who the county is getting to find a replacement...is none other than Lee Brown, the original supervisor of the Atlanta PD, who was in office during the murders and the subsequent investigation. 
SNAP is right in part. 
Police and prosecutors have the tools. 
The will is another matter. 
Some do, individually. 
But institutionally? 
That's still the domain of those who don't. 
lots of important stories out there today jeff....thank god and a few good souls for that conviction. 
Have you sent this to congress yet? 
talk about law enforcement not having the will... 
CRACKDOWN ON POLYGAMY GROUP 
Small polygamous groups have existed in the southwestern US under the watchful yet fairly benign eye of authorities ever since a sect known as the Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints (FLDS) separated itself from mainstream Mormonism in 1890. 
... 
Now, FLDS leader Warren Jeffs has been added to the FBI's list of "Ten Most Wanted Fugitives," a move that caps law enforcement's dramatic change of approach toward the polygamous group in recent years...[because of] the impact that the group's practices, law enforcement officials say, are having on the most vulnerable within the sect, particularly children and women. 
When the FLDS under Mr. Jeffs (and his father before him) grew to some 10,000 followers in several southwestern communities with estimated assets of $110 million; when it became clear that government officials, school authorities, and police in those communities had become intertwined with the sect; when ex-members increasingly reported child and sexual abuse charges (mainly involving underage girls forced to marry older men); and when the sect began to use secluded compounds, state and federal authorities started to crack down more vigorously. 
... 
Specifically, Jeffs is charged in Utah and Arizona with sexual assault of underage girls and with arranging "spiritual" marriages for girls and older men. 
At weekend press conferences in Salt Lake City and Phoenix, FBI and state officials said Jeffs "is considered armed and dangerous and may be traveling with armed bodyguards." 
In the past, he has talked in apocalyptic terms about a violent end to the world, according to former members. 
... 
As with Christian Identity and other hate-related philosophies tied to the Aryan Nations and the neo-Nazi Creativity Movement, Jeffs has preached racism as well. 
"The black race is the people through which the devil has always been able to bring evil unto the earth," Jeffs has said as cited by the Southern Poverty Law Center's "Intelligence Report." 
An editorial in the church-owned Deseret Morning News in Salt Lake City earlier this year acknowledged that "the state's history, a conservative belief in free choice, and an unwillingness to stir up a hornet's nest in the national media have likely all contributed to the kid-glove approach lawmakers and law-enforcement officers have taken when dealing with polygamous communities."

Maybe I'm missing something here, but how, exactly, does one 'Loose' 200,000 AK47's? 
"There's no tracking mechanism in place"?!?!? 
Never mind. 
No need to worry. 
I'm sure this kind of thing goes on all the time. 
We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.... 
just go here, its simply amazing 
The Raw Story 
i count like 14 explosive headlines. 
Then, of course, there is the evidence the jury did not hear about in the Robinson case... 
Funny how some things are squirelled away by well-meaning prosecutors... 
Maybe because they hint at a larger conspiracy/network of abusers/satanic underground? 
I read of a case not long ago when some people were trying to get a polygamous judge taken off the bench for not obeying state law. 
Of course law enforcement has dragged it's feet when members are taking part in the activity themselves. 
Personally I don't give a damn what adults do to one another as long as there is no abuse invovled. 
It is the marrying off of young girls to older men often close relatives that enfurates me. 
Also these cults have multimillions yet the women and kids live in poverty so the leaders can live the high life. 
In the Warren Jeffs cult he reassigns wives if the husband displeases him or to reward the new husband. 
Husbands marry mothers and teen daughters at the same time. 
a rare form of retardation is showing up in that group more than anywhere else in the world. 
It is genetic and the child needs to get the gene from both parents to turn into a vegetable instead of a thinking child. 
The doctor begs them to stop intermarrying but they say they have to keep the blood pure. 
look up fumarase deficiency for more info. 
Also look up the kingston family. 
One member actually was convicted of beating his teen daughter unconcious when she ran away from 'marriage' to her father's own brother. 
no one was charged for forced marriage, only the beating. 
So we "lost" some weapon? 
It's a good thing too. 
We wouldn't want those terrorists to run out of shit to shoot at us. 
Then the war might stop & all those juicy profits would just evaporate. 
What's a few dead soldiers in comparison to keeping all those defense contractors awash in all that tax cash? 
They really are milking the incompetence angle though, aren't they? 
Just another big Iraq whoopsie daisy, huh? 
Christ, you'd think America would get a bit tired of these guys treating her like she was populated with nothing but gullible idiots. 
I suppose that it's damn lucky for the GOP that she is populated with gullible idiots. 
US outsourcing special ops, intelligence to Iraq terror group, intelligence officials say 
The Pentagon is bypassing official US intelligence channels and turning to a dangerous and unruly cast of characters in order to create strife in Iran in preparation for any possible attack, former and current intelligence officials say... 
http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/US_outsourcing_special_operations_intelligence_gathering_0413.html 
A country deserves the leaders it has, my friends... 
And MEK -- the Iranian (not Iraqi) terror group in question -- is itself unquestionably a cult: 
As the leaders like to boast, the Mujahedeen is a family affair. 
(''We have three generations of martyrs: grandmothers, mothers, daughters.'') 
Most of the girls I was meeting had grown up in Mujahedeen schools in Ashraf, where they lived separated from their parents. 
Family visits were allowed on Thursday nights and Fridays. 
When Iraq invaded Kuwait, many of these girls were transported to Jordan and then smuggled to various countries -- Germany, France, Canada, Denmark, England, the United States -- where they were raised by guardians who were usually Mujahedeen supporters. 
When they were 18 or 19, many of them decided to come back to Iraq and fill the ranks of the youngest Mujahedeen generation. 
Though ''decided'' is probably not the right word, since from the day they were born, these girls and boys were not taught to think for themselves but to blindly follow their leaders. 
''Every morning and night, the kids, beginning as young as 1 and 2, had to stand before a poster of Massoud and Maryam, salute them and shout praises to them,'' Nadereh Afshari, a former Mujahedeen deep-believer, told me. 
Afshari, who was posted in Germany and was responsible for receiving Mujahedeen children during the gulf war, said that when the German government tried to absorb Mujahedeen children into their education system, the Mujahedeen refused. 
Many of the children were sent to Mujahedeen schools, particularly in France. 
The Rajavis, Afshari went on to say, ''saw these kids as the next generation's soldiers. 
They wanted to brainwash them and control them.'' 
Which may explain the pattern to their stories: a journey to self-empowerment and the enlightenment of self-sacrifice inspired by the light and wisdom of Maryam and Massoud.

One has to wonder whether the bright fellows in our government and military who set up the deals with these people don't know what they are, don't care, or know perfectly well. 
Jeff, 
SPLOID.com cited you on the topic of that priest conviction: http://www.sploid.com/news/2006/05/evil_priest_gui.php 
Umm... 
Question Mark 
Jimmy Plant, Blogshares is a fantasy blogosphere trading game with pretend money. 
That's all I know; I've had nothing to do with it. 
Bush successfully makes Satan look good in comparison. 
Or something like that.

"Another generation of heavy metal has taken over, and -- sorry -- it ain't just about strippers and dope. 
Okay, it's partly about strippers and dope. 
And we'll get around to that. 
But more and more, as metal evolves into a huge international music that belongs to everyone, it has gotten to be something weirder. 
It's become a guardian of morality -- not church morality; real morality. 
Praise be: Given the void in responsible behavior among governments, police, educational establishments and religions, the task of guiding our youth down the path of righteousness has fallen to... Satan" 
Hmmmmmm.................... 
The people who carry out these underground arms/drugs/sex trafficking deals are trauma based mind controlled slaves. 
The Moldovan airline is Aerocom, and yes, it's one of Victor Bout's. 
The wikipedia entry for Aerocom is just a stub .. waiting for someone to put some information into it.... 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerocom 
So... put some information in there. 
You know, nature hates a void. :) 
Richard, 
i agree, Hmmmmmm. 
How are chants of death and suicide ... morality. 
What about Manson's tees bearing the message, "Kill your parents". 
And were the Columbine killers acting out this "real morality" when they indescriminately murdered their classmates. 
They were death metal brainwashed fans, literally fulfilling the death metal paradigm, er ... morality. 
(not church morality, no that is phoney, love thy neighbor ... hell no, kill thy neighbor - now that is REAL MORALITY ?????) 
So, hmmmm indeed. 
I detect the hissing lisp of the lying serpent in this article. 
The deathly inversion of truth, ala satanism. 
I think the jury's still out on exactly who did the brainwashing when in regard to the Columbine killers. 
Perhaps we should look at the death metal phenomenon less as an invitation to violence than as a couter-cultural response to the over hypocrisy of a large percentage of the 'Church-Morality' crowd, which gives a lot of lip service to loving thy neighbor, but doesn't apply that love very far beyond their own congregation. 
The last I checked, the Satanists have a long way to go to catch up with the death and destruction dealt out by self-proclaimed (though false) Christians. 
Irony is dead...Long live Irony! 
That's it. 
I'm firing my editor. 
Well, it's not as simple and clear cut as all that. 
We're entering into some interesting and perhaps previously unexplored socio-political-spiritual territory here that may require further examination and serious introspection. 
The Kevin Coogan publication posted on the previous thread might serve as a good launching point for further discussion. 
The following quote is from that Coogan article: 
Imaginary evil is romantic and varied; real evil is gloomy, monotonous, barren, boring. 
Imaginary good is boring; real good is always new, marvelous, intoxicating. 
- Simone Weil 
Starroute: 
I wouldn't wonder too hard. 
The answer is likely D: all of the above, due to this being a complex reality we live in. 
But to me, without question, they often know perfectly well. 
Here is a thought: When the appartently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent, it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives. 
They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions, while they "do as they wilt".

To not buying the BS 
& here I am thinking that I really must be getting old. 
Since the article was specifically about "death metal" I guess the author missed this little tidbit or we just have waaaaaaaaaaaaay different definitions of morality: 
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/4446342.stm 
One man's relentless search for his missing son led him to uncover one of the most shocking crimes in post-war Italy - a tale of satanism and violence that has gripped the country for more than a year. 
In January 1998 Fabio Tollis and Chiara Marino, both just 16, disappeared. 
They had been drinking at a pub called the Midnight - the centre of the heavy metal scene in Milan - and they never came home. 
The police and many of their friends just thought they had run off together. 
But their parents refused to accept this. 
Michele Tollis, Fabio's father, began to attend metal concerts and festivals across Europe, handing out leaflets and quizzing Fabio's friends. 
Fabio and his friends were into the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story. 
No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked 
Michele Tollis 
It emerged that Chiara, the girl who disappeared with Fabio, had a collection of satanic literature and paraphernalia in her bedroom. 
During this search, Michele Tollis became convinced that satanism had something to do with his son's disappearance. 
"No one can contradict me when I say that heavy metal and satanism are closely linked. 
They're inseparable," he says. 
Yeah, I think Jeff wrote on one of his posts here in the past several months: "To hell with death". 
I wholly agree, and would expand that statement to include: "To hell with death metal". 
The freaky thing here is that these bozos are seriously claiming the moral high ground ? ? ? ? ? 
Talk about a beat-your-head-against-the-wall moment! 
And for 'Smartwolf' above, think about the inversion principle being employed. 
They are doing it deliberately. 
Do you really think GWB, and neocons in general are representative of true followers of Jesus of Nazareth? 
(I know, ignorant question) Then why call them, or any other phonies 'Christians', even if they themselves claim the appellation. 
They are merely imposters. 
Everything they claim is a lie, and this above all. 
So why even credit their claims? 
This only serves their purposes. 
They want to be identified as 'Christians', and I fully suspect that for some of them, the motivation behind their subterfuge is more than mere political advantage, and has a lot more to do with the black magician's practice of the inversion principle. 
We need to be more 'rigorous' about how we perceive these people. 
See them as they are, not for what they claim to be. 
... the most extreme forms of heavy metal music - death metal and black metal, music obsessed with images of murder and satanism - and the role of this music is central to the story. 
Almost all of the avant guard art movements of the early 20th Century (except for Italian Futurism) were labeled 'degenerate' by the National Socialists. 
Adolf Hitler even held an exhibition of 'degenerate art' in 1937, while curating a parallel show of 'Aryan' art across the street. 
The German Expressionist movement was destroyed as a result. 
Here's a quick overview of the Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art) exhibit of 1937: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_art 
Ironically (or perhaps not), the notion of the 'degenerate' and 'degenerate art' was appropriated by the Nazis and its origins can be traced back to Jewish 'intellectual' Max Nordau and a 1892 book he authored called Degeneration. . 
Nordau was also the co founder of the World Zionist Organization. 
When the apparently cognitively functional take actions that seem senseless and incompetent, it is a most certain sign that they have ulterior or hidden motives. 
They trust you and me to be befuddled by their actions, while they "do as they wilt." 
A question: 
Are the adherent of 'Crowleyan Thelema' and others of similar ilk appropriating or appropriating from the appropriators to redirect 'energy?' 
Does this reappropriation lead to or originate from the same place? 
Seems as if there is a clear distinction being made between the 'imaginary' Whore of Babalon and the actually Whore of Babylon, which is this global system. 
Is the distinction accurate and valid? 
Does the distinction actually exist? 
This is where the socio- political aspect of this conundrum comes into play. 
Confused? 
Good. 
so, enemy, what's your point? 
Why don't you state it? 
My point is that these are all just questions and I am undecided as to the answers. 
Here's another interesting example: 
John Balance from Coil. 
(Don't wish to use Wikipedia again, it's just easier than spending time looking up more obscure and detailed information.) 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Balance 
http://www.guardian.co.uk/obituaries/story/0,3604,1371372,00.html 
Balance died in 2004 after a 'fall.' 
He blended belief systems such as Shamanism, Christianity, Buddhism, Paganism, Hermeticism and Gnosticism and imbued Coil's vast output with a magickal current designed to have a functionally transcendent effect on listeners. 
Not 200,000 guns - the numbers dont work: 
5kg per gun, 200,000 guns means 1000 tonnes, impossible for 4 containers. 
If the load was 99 tonnes there were probably less than 20,000. 
E@tG: 
Maybe if you formulate your questions a little more specifically it will help you in acquiring the answers.

Reporting from the town where Susan Polk's trial is going on. 
I went across the bay last night to attend a farmer's market and music event. 
Lo and behold, the Mormons were there with a booth. 
Two young men delivering information about the Mormon genealogy program. 
Just give your email and/or phone number to these guys and they'll track down your family. 
I was amazed at the spiel they delivered. 
Kindly young men, but utterly programmed and brain-dead. 
I resisted asking any questions that would have required either of them to think. 
It would have been too painful to watch. 
Has anyone read the letter purportedly from Ahmadinejad to George Bush? 
http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/article.asp?id=4503 
I don't know if this has been verified. 
But succintly making point after succint point, the text of the letter stands on its own merit, regardless. 
I like to imagine the thought processes going on in W's head if he were to actually read the letter, but it is hard to picture him actually reading this letter. 
As I read the letter, I considered the vast contrast between mind and morality of whoever wrote it, vs. that of the mind of the man who once said "Bring it on!" 
America, your condition is dire, dark and deep. 
Of the metal music farce, Ministry has definately made in-road into 'Loose Change"-"Alex Jones" territory with their new record, Rio Grande Blood.

very creepy, very scary

==Why did Bush revoke Executive Order 13011 today?

Fri May 12, 2006 at 08:27:46 PM PDT 
In scanning the whitehouse.gov site today, I noticed the following Executive Order: 
Executive Order: Amendments to Executive Orders 11030, 13279, 13339, 13381, and 13389, and ***Revocation*** of Executive Order 13011.... 
I can't believe there are no serious metal fans who frequent RI. 
I'm wary of jumping into this fray without backup, that's for damn sure. :) 
I'm a regular poster but for some reason blogger won't let me in today...but sign me TroubleFunk. 
Tronicus: 
Simply, the questions permeate the entire 'Western (Mystery) Tradition' and perhaps 'Eastern' as well, as they relate to the confluence of politics and spirituality. 
For example, is the system of Crowleyan Thelema a failed alchemical process? 
Or was it supposed to initially be a process of alchemical appropriation? 
Similarly, is invoking ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses a reaffirmation of an oppressive and hierarchical system? 
In my opinion, people can no longer afford to partition out and compartmentalize personal spiritual and political systems. 
The 'high weirdness' and more hardcore political 'factions' must perhaps integrate and arrive at a synthesis. 
In regards to death metal, the problem is, once again, a question of education, history and the vacuous lack of perspective in American culture. 
Shall we censor the works of poet Charles Baudelaire as well? 
Baudelaire was perhaps one of the first 'death metal' artists. 
Tronicus, if you're still checking this thread: 
A bit of a knee-jerk reaction from me there, and I apologize for my over-generalizations. 
My real problem is with literalist fundamentalists, of any religion. 
True believers are dangerous animals. 
I just get hung up on 'Christians', as they're the dominant form where I come from. 
Also, I'm quite clear on the fact that those in power now (and, in general, most anyone at the top of a pyrimidal power structure) tend to use the dominant religion as a cloak to hide their true motivations and as a tool to control the masses. 
It boggles the mind that ANYONE can take at face value Bush's claims to be a christian, yet many seem to do just that. 
I seem to remember something about 'by their works shall ye know them." 
I do get my hackles up a bit when people haul out the old 'Rock-N-Roll made them do it' argument. 
Whie I don't subscribe to the notion that the things we watch or listen to have no effect on our behavior (which I think is patently rediculous), it does bother me when people single out a specific group of people to pin the blame on. 
Sub-cultures (as the lable implies) do not develope in a vacuum. 
Again, I think the problem is people who sink to far into their own egos, and begin to take their personal metaphors a bit too literaly. 
These people are dangerous wether they're head-banging to 'Canibal Corpse' or humming along to 'Onward Christian Soldiers'. 
(The mixing of religion and militarism is a whole other topic....) 
I have nothing but respect for people who adhear to non-violence, forgiveness, and charity, but it's important to remember that Christians (or 'Smartwolves') do not have a monopoly on that particular lifestyle. 
Peace. 
The fact that the US government and media are having a hissy fit over Venezuela wanting to buy guns, and then 200,000 of the guns Chavez wants to buy go missing on their way to Iraq is definitely sus. 
I guess those guns will be located enroute to Venezuela or found in storage there by one of the US's local stooges and they then have a pretext to ramp the spin up a notch or two. 
Thanks again to my friend Nick Keck for passing this along via e-mail. 
It is the text of a speech given by an Arab gentleman before the advisory board of a large multi-nation corporation. 
It's a long but very worthwhile read. 
"A View from the Eye of the Storm" 
Talk delivered by Haim Harari at a meeting of the International Advisory Board of a large multi-national corporation, April, 2004: 
"As you know, I usually provide the scientific and technological "entertainment" in our meetings, but, on this occasion, our Chairman suggested that I present my own personal view on events in the part of the world from which I come. 
I have never been and I will never be a Government official and I have no privileged information. 
My perspective is entirely based on what I see, on what I read and on the fact that my family has lived in this region for almost 200 years. 
You may regard my views as those of the proverbial taxi driver, which you are supposed to question, when you visit a country. 
I could have shared with you some fascinating facts and some personal thoughts about the Israeli-Arab conflict. 
However, I will touch upon it only in passing. 
I prefer to devote most of my remarks to the broader picture of the region and its place in world events. 
I refer to the entire area between Pakistan and Morocco, which is predominantly Arab, predominantly Moslem, but includes many non-Arab and also significant non-Moslem minorities. 
Why do I put aside Israel and its own immediate neighborhood? 
Because Israel and any problems related to it, in spite of what you might read or hear in the world media, is not the central issue, and has never been the central issue in the upheaval in the region. 
Yes, there is a 100 year-old Israeli-Arab conflict, but it is not where the main show is. 
The millions who died in the Iran-Iraq war had nothing to do with Israel. 
The mass murder happening right now in Sudan, where the Arab Moslem regime is massacring its black Christian citizens, has nothing to do with Israel. 
The frequent reports from Algeria about the murders of hundreds of civilians in one village or another by other Algerians have nothing to do with Israel. 
Saddam Hussein did not invade Kuwait, endanger Saudi Arabia and butcher his own people because of Israel. 
Egypt did not use poison gas against Yemen in the 60's because of Israel. 
Assad the Father did not kill tens of thousands of his own citizens in one week in El Hamma in Syria because of Israel. 
The Taliban control of Afghanistan and the civil war there had nothing to do with Israel. 
The Libyan blowing up of the Pan-Am flight had nothing to do with Israel, and I could go on and on and on. 
The root of the trouble is that this entire Moslem region is totally dysfunctional, by any standard of the word, and would have been so even if Israel had joined the Arab league and an independent Palestine had existed for 100 years. 
The 22 member countries of the Arab league, from Mauritania to the Gulf States, have a total population of 300 millions, larger than the US and almost as large as the EU before its expansion. 
They have a land area larger than either the US or all of Europe. 
These 22 countries, with all their oil and natural resources, have a combined GDP smaller than that of Netherlands plus Belgium and equal to half of the GDP of California alone. 
Within this meager GDP, the gaps between rich and poor are beyond belief and too many of the rich made their money not by succeeding in business, but by being corrupt rulers. 
The social status of women is far below what it was in the Western World 150 years ago. 
Human rights are below any reasonable standard, in spite of the grotesque fact that Libya was elected Chair of the UN Human Rights commission. 
According to a report prepared by a committee of Arab intellectuals and published under the auspices of the U.N., the number of books translated by the entire Arab world is much smaller than what little Greece alone translates. 
The total number of scientific publications of 300 million Arabs is less than that of 6 million Israelis. 
Birth rates in the region are very high, increasing the poverty, the social gaps and the cultural decline. 
And all of this is happening in a region, which only 30 years ago, was believed to be the next wealthy part of the world, and in a Moslem area, which developed, at some point in history, one of the most advanced cultures in the world. 
It is fair to say that this creates an unprecedented breeding ground for cruel dictators, terror networks, fanaticism, incitement, suicide murders and general decline. 
It is also a fact that almost everybody in the region blames this situation on the United States, on Israel, on Western Civilization, on Judaism and Christianity, on anyone and anything, except themselves. 
A word about the millions of decent, honest, good people who are either devout Moslems or are not very religious but grew up in Moslem families: They are double victims of an outside world, which now develops Islamophobia, and of their own environment which breaks their heart by being totally dysfunctional. 
The problem is that the vast silent majority of these Moslems are not part of the terror and the incitement, but they also do not stand up against it. 
They become accomplices, by omission, and this applies to political leaders, intellectuals, business people and many others. 
Many of them can certainly tell right from wrong, but are afraid to express their views. 
The events of the last few years have amplified four issues, which have always existed, but have never been as rampant as in the present upheaval in the region. 
A few more years may pass before everybody acknowledges that it is a World War, but we are already well into it. 
These are the four main pillars of the current World Conflict, or perhaps we should already refer to it as "the undeclared World War III": 
*1. The first element is the suicide murder.* 
Suicide murders are not a new invention but they have been made popular, if I may use this expression, only lately. 
Even after September 11, it seems that most of the Western World does not yet understand this weapon. 
It is a very potent psychological weapon. 
Its real direct impact is relatively minor. 
The total number of casualties from hundreds of suicide murders within Israel in the last three years is much smaller than those due to car accidents. 
September 11 was quantitatively much less lethal than many earthquakes 
More people die from AIDS in one day in Africa than all the Russians who died in the hands of Chechnya-based Moslem suicide murderers since that conflict started. 
Saddam killed every month more people than all those who died from suicide murders since the Coalition occupation of Iraq. 
So what is all the fuss about suicide killings? 
It creates headlines. 
It is spectacular. 
It is frightening. 
It is a very cruel death with bodies dismembered and horrible severe lifelong injuries to many of the wounded. 
It is always shown on television in great detail. 
One such murder, with the help of hysterical media coverage, can destroy the tourism industry of a country for quite a while, as it did in Bali and in Turkey. 
But the real fear comes from the undisputed fact that no defense and no preventive measures can succeed against a determined suicide murderer. 
This has not yet penetrated the thinking of the Western World. 
The U.S. and Europe are constantly improving their defense against the last murder, not the next one. 
We may arrange for the best airport security in the world. 
But if you want to murder by suicide, you do not have to board a plane in order to explode yourself and kill many people. 
Who could stop a suicide murder in the midst of the crowded line waiting to be checked by the airport metal detector? 
How about the lines to the check-in counters in a busy travel period? 
Put a metal detector in front of every train station in Spain and the terrorists will get the buses. 
Protect the buses and they will explode in movie theaters, concert halls, supermarkets, shopping malls, schools and hospitals. 
Put guards in front of every concert hall and there will always be a line of people to be checked by the guards and this line will be the target, not to speak of killing the guards themselves. 
You can somewhat reduce your vulnerability by preventive and defensive measures and by strict border controls but not eliminate it and definitely not win the war in a defensive way. 
And it is a war! 
What is behind the suicide murders? 
Money is, money and power and cold-blooded murderous incitement, nothing else. 
It has nothing to do with true fanatic religious beliefs. 
No Moslem preacher has ever blown himself up. 
No son of an Arab politician or religious leader has ever blown himself up. 
No relative of anyone influential has done it. 
Wouldn't you expect some of the religious leaders to do it themselves, or to talk their sons into doing it, if this is truly a supreme act of religious fervor? 
Aren't they interested in the benefits of going to Heaven? 
Instead, they send outcast women, naive children, retarded people and young incited hotheads. 
They promise them the delights, mostly sexual, of the next world, and pay their families handsomely after the supreme act is performed and enough innocent people are dead. 
Suicide murders also have nothing to do with poverty and despair. 
The poorest region in the world, by far, is Africa. 
It never happens there. 
There are numerous desperate people in the world, in different cultures, countries and continents. 
Desperation does not provide anyone with explosives, reconnaissance and transportation. 
There was certainly more despair in Saddam's Iraq than in Paul Bremmer's Iraq, and no one exploded himself. 
A suicide murder is simply a horrible, vicious weapon of cruel, inhuman, cynical, well-funded terrorists, with no regard to human life, including the life of their fellow countrymen, but with very high regard to their own affluent well-being and their hunger for power. 
The only way to fight this new "popular" weapon is identical to the only way in which you fight organized crime or pirates on the high seas: the offensive way. 
Like in the case of organized crime, it is crucial that the forces on the offensive be united and it is crucial to reach the top of the crime pyramid. 
You cannot eliminate organized crime by arresting the little drug dealer on the street corner. 
You must go after the head of the "Family". 
If part of the public supports it, others tolerate it, many are afraid of it and some try to explain it away by poverty or by a miserable childhood, organized crime will thrive and so will terrorism. 
The United States understands this now, after September 11. 
Russia is beginning to understand it. 
Turkey understands it well. 
I am very much afraid that most of Europe still does not understand it. 
Unfortunately, it seems that Europe will understand it only after suicide murders arrive in Europe in a big way. 
In my humble opinion, this will definitely happen. 
The Spanish trains and the Istanbul bombings are only the beginning. 
The unity of the Civilized World in fighting this horror is absolutely indispensable. 
Until Europe wakes up, this unity will not be achieved. 
*2. The second ingredient is words, more precisely lies.* 
Words can be lethal. 
They kill people. 
It is often said that politicians, diplomats and perhaps also lawyers and business people must sometimes lie, as part of their professional life. 
But the norms of politics and diplomacy are childish, in comparison with the level of incitement and total absolute deliberate fabrications, which have reached new heights in the region we are talking about. 
An incredible number of people in the Arab world believe that September 11 never happened, or was an American provocation or, even better, a Jewish plot. 
You all remember the Iraqi Minister of Information, Mr. Mouhamad Said al-Sahaf and his press conferences when the US forces were already inside Baghdad. 
Disinformation at time of war is an accepted tactic. 
But to stand, day after day, and to make such preposterous statements, known to everybody to be lies, without even being ridiculed in your own milieu, can only happen in this region. 
Mr. Sahaf eventually became a popular icon as a court jester, but this did not stop some allegedly respectable newspapers from giving him equal time. 
It also does not prevent the Western press from giving credence, every day, even now, to similar liars. 
After all, if you want to be an anti-Semite, there are subtle ways of doing it. 
You do not have to claim that the holocaust never happened, and that the Jewish temple in Jerusalem never existed. 
But millions of Moslems are told by their leaders that this is the case. 
When these same leaders make other statements, the Western media report them as if they could be true. 
It is a daily occurrence that the same people who finance, arm and dispatch suicide murderers, condemn the act in English in front of western TV cameras, talking to a world audience, which even partly believes them. 
It is a daily routine to hear the same leader making opposite statements in Arabic to his people and in English to the rest of the world. 
Incitement by Arab TV, accompanied by horror pictures of mutilated bodies, has become a powerful weapon of those who lie, distort and want to destroy everything. 
Little children are raised on deep hatred and on admiration of so-called martyrs, and the Western World does not notice it because its own TV sets are mostly tuned to soap operas and game shows. 
I recommend to you, even though most of you do not understand Arabic, to watch Al Jazeera, from time to time. 
You will not believe your own eyes. 
But words also work in other ways, more subtle. 
A demonstration in Berlin, carrying banners supporting Saddam's regime and featuring three-year old babies dressed as suicide murderers, is defined by the press and by political leaders as a "peace demonstration". 
You may support or oppose the Iraq war, but to refer to fans of Saddam, Arafat or Bin Laden as peace activists is a bit too much. 
A woman walks into an Israeli restaurant in mid-day, eats, observes families with old people and children eating their lunch in the adjacent tables and pays the bill. 
She then blows herself up, killing 20 people, including many children, with heads and arms rolling around in the restaurant. 
She is called "martyr" by several Arab leaders and "activist" by the European press. 
Dignitaries condemn the act but visit her bereaved family and the money flows. 
There is a new game in town: The actual murderer is called "the military wing", the one who pays him, equips him and sends him is now called "the political wing" and the head of the operation is called the "spiritual leader". 
There are numerous other examples of such Orwellian nomenclature, used every day not only by terror chiefs but also by Western media. 
These words are much more dangerous than many people realize. 
They provide an emotional infrastructure for atrocities. 
It was Joseph Goebbels who said that if you repeat a lie often enough, people will believe it. 
He is now being outperformed by his successors. 
*3. The third aspect is money.* 
Huge amounts of money, which could have solved many social problems in this dysfunctional part of the world, are channeled into three concentric spheres supporting death and murder. 
In the inner circle are the terrorists themselves. 
The money funds their travel, explosives, hideouts and permanent search for soft vulnerable targets. 
The inner circles are primarily financed by terrorist states like Iran and Syria, until recently also by Iraq and Libya and earlier also by some of the Communist regimes. 
These states, as well as the Palestinian Authority, are the safe havens of the wholesale murder vendors. 
They are surrounded by a second wider circle of direct supporters, planners, commanders, preachers, all of whom make a living, usually a very comfortable living, by serving as terror infrastructure. 
Finally, we find the third circle of so-called religious, educational and welfare organizations, which actually do some good, feed the hungry and provide some schooling, but brainwash a new generation with hatred, lies and ignorance. 
This circle operates mostly through mosques, madrasas and other religious establishments but also through inciting electronic and printed media. 
It is this circle that makes sure that women remain inferior, that democracy is unthinkable and that exposure to the outside world is minimal. 
It is also that circle that leads the way in blaming everybody outside the Moslem world, for the miseries of the region. 
The outer circle is largely financed by Saudi Arabia, but also by donations from certain Moslem communities in the United States and Europe and, to a smaller extent, by donations of European Governments to various NGO's and by certain United Nations organizations, whose goals may be noble, but they are infested and exploited by agents of the outer circle. 
The Saudi regime, of course, will be the next victim of major terror, when the inner circle will explode into the outer circle. 
The Saudis are beginning to understand it, but they fight the inner circles, while still financing the infrastructure at the outer circle. 
Figuratively speaking, this outer circle is the guardian, which makes sure that the people look and listen inwards to the inner circle of terror and incitement, rather than to the world outside. 
Some parts of this same outer circle actually operate as a result of fear from, or blackmail by, the inner circles. 
The horrifying added factor is the high birth rate. 
Half of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 20, the most receptive age to incitement, guaranteeing two more generations of blind hatred. 
Some of the leaders of these various circles live very comfortably on their loot. 
You meet their children in the best private schools in Europe, not in the training camps of suicide murderers. 
The Jihad "soldiers" join packaged death tours to Iraq and other hotspots, while some of their leaders ski in Switzerland. 
Mrs. Arafat, who lives in Paris with her daughter, receives tens of thousands of dollars per month from the allegedly bankrupt Palestinian Authority, while a typical local ringleader of the Al-Aksa brigade, reporting to Arafat, receives only a cash payment of a couple of hundred dollars, for performing murders at the retail level. 
*4. The fourth element of the current world conflict is the total breaking of all laws.* 
The civilized world believes in democracy, the rule of law, including international law, human rights, free speech and free press, among other liberties. 
There are naive old-fashioned habits such as respecting religious sites and symbols, not using ambulances and hospitals for acts of war, avoiding the mutilation of dead bodies and not using children as human shields or human bombs. 
Never in history, not even in the Nazi period, was there such total disregard of all of the above as we observe now. 
Every student of political science debates how you prevent an anti-democratic force from winning a democratic election and abolishing democracy. 
Other aspects of a civilized society must also have limitations. 
Can a policeman open fire on someone trying to kill him? 
Can a government listen to phone conversations of terrorists and drug dealers? 
Does free speech protect you when you shout "fire" in a crowded theater? 
Should there be death penalty, for deliberate multiple murders? 
These are the old-fashioned dilemmas. 
But now we have an entire new set. 
Do you raid a mosque, which serves as a terrorist ammunition storage? 
Do you return fire, if you are attacked from a hospital? 
Do you storm a church taken over by terrorists who took the priests hostages? 
Do you search every ambulance after a few suicide murderers use ambulances to reach their targets? 
Do you strip every woman because one pretended to be pregnant and carried a suicide bomb on her belly? 
Do you shoot back at someone trying to kill you, standing deliberately behind a group of children? 
Do you raid terrorist headquarters, hidden in a mental hospital? 
Do you shoot an arch-murderer who deliberately moves from one location to another, always surrounded by children? 
All of these happen daily in Iraq and in the Palestinian areas. 
What do you do? 
Well, you do not want to face the dilemma. 
But it cannot be avoided. 
Suppose, for the sake of discussion, that someone would openly stay in a well-known address in Teheran, hosted by the Iranian Government and financed by it, executing one atrocity after another in Spain or in France, killing hundreds of innocent people, accepting responsibility for the crimes, promising in public TV interviews to do more of the same, while the Government of Iran issues public condemnations of his acts but continues to host him, invite him to official functions and treat him as a great dignitary. 
I leave it to you as homework to figure out what Spain or France would have done, in such a situation. 
The problem is that the civilized world is still having illusions about the rule of law in a totally lawless environment. 
It is trying to play ice hockey by sending a ballerina ice-skater into the ring or to knock out a heavyweight boxer by a chess player. 
In the same way that no country has a law against cannibals eating its prime minister, because such an act is unthinkable, international law does not address killers shooting from hospitals, mosques and ambulances, while being protected by their Government or society. 
International law does not know how to handle someone who sends children to throw stones, stands behind them and shoots with immunity and cannot be arrested because he is sheltered by a Government. 
International law does not know how to deal with a leader of murderers who is royally and comfortably hosted by a country, which pretends to condemn his acts or just claims to be too weak to arrest him. 
The amazing thing is that all of these crooks demand protection under international law, and define all those who attack them as "war criminals," with some Western media repeating the allegations. 
The good news is that all of this is temporary, because the evolution of international law has always adapted itself to reality. 
The punishment for suicide murder should be death or arrest before the murder, not during and not after. 
After every world war, the rules of international law have changed, and the same will happen after the present one. 
But during the twilight zone, a lot of harm can be done. 
The picture I described here is not pretty. 
What can we do about it? 
In the short run, only fight and win. 
In the long run, only educate the next generation and open it to the world. 
The inner circles can and must be destroyed by force. 
The outer circle cannot be eliminated by force. 
Here we need financial starvation of the organizing elite, more power to women, more education, counter-propaganda, boycott whenever feasible and access to Western media, internet and the international scene. 
Above all, we need a total absolute unity and determination of the civilized world against all three circles of evil. 
Allow me, for a moment, to depart from my alleged role as a taxi driver and return to science. 
When you have a malignant tumor, you may remove the tumor itself surgically. 
You may also starve it by preventing new blood from reaching it from other parts of the body, thereby preventing new "supplies" from expanding the tumor. 
If you want to be sure, it is best to do both. 
But before you fight and win, by force or otherwise, you have to realize that you are in a war, and this may take Europe a few more years. 
In order to win, it is necessary to first eliminate the terrorist regimes, so that no Government in the world will serve as a safe haven for these people. 
I do not want to comment here on whether the American-led attack on Iraq was justified from the point of view of weapons of mass destruction or any other pre-war argument, but I can look at the post-war map of Western Asia. 
Now that Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya are out, two and a half terrorist states remain: Iran, Syria and Lebanon, the latter being a Syrian colony. 
Perhaps Sudan should be added to the list. 
As a result of the conquest of Afghanistan and Iraq, both Iran and Syria are now totally surrounded by territories unfriendly to them. 
Iran is encircled by Afghanistan, by the Gulf States, Iraq and the Moslem republics of the former Soviet Union. 
Syria is surrounded by Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Israel. 
This is a significant strategic change and it applies strong pressure on the terrorist countries. 
It is not surprising that Iran is so active in trying to incite a Shiite uprising in Iraq. 
I do not know if the American plan was actually to encircle both Iran and Syria, but that is the resulting situation. 
In my humble opinion, the number one danger to the world today is Iran and its regime. 
It definitely has ambitions to rule vast areas and to expand in all directions. 
It has an ideology which claims supremacy over Western culture. 
It is ruthless. 
It has proven that it can execute elaborate terrorist acts without leaving too many traces, using Iranian Embassies. 
It is clearly trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
Its so-called moderates and conservatives play their own virtuoso version of the "good-cop versus bad-cop" game. 
Iran sponsors Syrian terrorism, it is certainly behind much of the action in Iraq, it is fully funding the Hezbollah and, through it, the Palestinian Hamas and Islamic Jihad; it performed acts of terror at least in Europe and in South America and probably also in Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia and it truly leads a multi-national terror consortium, which includes, as minor players, Syria, Lebanon and certain Shiite elements in Iraq. 
Nevertheless, most European countries still trade with Iran, try to appease it and refuse to read the clear signals. 
In order to win the war it is also necessary to dry the financial resources of the terror conglomerate. 
It is pointless to try to understand the subtle differences between the Sunni terror of Al Qaeda and Hamas and the Shiite terror of Hezbollah, Sadr and other Iranian-inspired enterprises. 
When it serves their business needs, all of them collaborate beautifully. 
It is crucial to stop Saudi and other financial support of the outer circle, which is the fertile breeding ground of terror. 
It is important to monitor all donations from the Western World to Islamic organizations, to monitor the finances of international relief organizations and to react with forceful economic measures to any small sign of financial aid to any of the three circles of terrorism. 
It is also important to act decisively against the campaign of lies and fabrications and to monitor those Western media who collaborate with it out of naivety, financial interests or ignorance. 
Above all, never surrender to terror. 
No one will ever know whether the recent elections in Spain would have yielded a different result, if not for the train bombings a few days earlier. 
But it really does not matter. 
What matters is that the terrorists believe that they caused the result and that they won by driving Spain out of Iraq. 
The Spanish story will surely end up being extremely costly to other European countries, including France, who is now expelling inciting preachers and forbidding veils and including others who sent troops to Iraq. 
In the long run, Spain itself will pay even more. 
Is the solution a democratic Arab world? 
If by democracy we mean free elections but also free press, free speech, a functioning judicial system, civil liberties, equality to women, free international travel, exposure to international media and ideas, laws against racial incitement and against defamation, and avoidance of lawless behavior regarding hospitals, places of worship and children, then yes, democracy is the solution. 
If democracy is just free elections, it is likely that the most fanatic regime will be elected, the one whose incitement and fabrications are the most inflammatory. 
We have seen it already in Algeria and, to a certain extent, in Turkey. 
It will happen again, if the ground is not prepared very carefully. 
On the other hand, a certain transition democracy, as in Jordan, may be a better temporary solution, paving the way for the real thing, perhaps in the same way that an immediate sudden democracy did not work in Russia and would not have worked in China. 
I have no doubt that the civilized world will prevail. 
But the longer it takes us to understand the new landscape of this war, the more costly and painful the victory will be. 
Europe, more than any other region, is the key. 
Its understandable recoil from wars, following the horrors of World War II, may cost thousands of additional innocent lives, before the tide will turn." 
Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest. 
Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed's taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders. 
By 1998, Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime. 
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980. 
According to senior counter terrorism officials, both here and abroad, among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it. 
Al Qaeda, Anthrax and Ayman: Means, Motive, Modus Operandi and Opportunity 
Homeland Security 
In early June 2003, a Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA") report publicly disclosed that the reason for Mohammed Atta's and Zacarias Moussaoui's inquiries into cropdusters was for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax. 
An early September 2003 Newsweek article included a rumor by a Taliban source that at a meeting in April 2003 Bin Laden was planning an "unbelievable" biological attack, the plans for which had suffered a setback upon the arrest of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed ("KSM"). 
He had been captured the previous month in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. 
In November 2003, a report by a UN Panel of experts concluded that Al Qaeda is determined to use chemical and biological weapons and is restrained only by technical difficulties. 
In a statement issued June 16, 2004, the 9/11 Commission Staff concluded that "Al Qaeda had an ambitious biological weapons program and was making advances in its ability to produce anthrax prior to September 11. 
According to Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet, al Qaeda’s ability to conduct an anthrax attack is one of the most immediate threats the United States is likely to face." 
On August 9, 2004, it was announced that in the Spring of 2001, a man named El-Shukrijumah, also known as Jafar the Pilot, who was part of a "second wave," had been casing New York City helicopters. 
Photographs from a seized computer disc included the controls and the locks on the door between the passengers and pilot. 
In a bulletin, the FBI noted that the surveillance might relate to a plot to disperse a chemical or biological weapon. 
The CIA reportedly has been quietly building a case that the anthrax mailings were an international plot. 
This is old news. 
It's just no longer bureaucratically impolite to openly contest the FBI's (former) theory about a lone, American scientist. 
Many people have argued that a US-based Al Qaeda operative is behind the earlier Fall 2001 anthrax mailings in the US, and that the mailings served as a threat and warning. 
Princeton islamist scholar Bernard Lewis has explained that while islamists may disagree about whether killing innocents is sanctioned by the laws of jihad, extremists like Zawahiri agree that notice must be given before biochemical weapons are used. 
"The Prophet's guidance," says Michael Scheuer, an al-Qaeda analyst who recently retired from the CIA and once headed its Bin Laden unit, "was always, Before you attack someone, warn them very clearly..." The anthrax mailings followed the pattern of letters they sent in January 1997 to newspaper branches in Washington, D.C. and New York City, as well as symbolic targets. 
The letter bombs were sent in connection with the detention of the blind sheik Abdel Rahman and those responsible for the earlier World Trade Center bombing in 1993. 
Handwritten notes and files on a laptop seized upon the capture of KSM, Al Qaeda's #3, included a feasible anthrax production plan using a spray dryer and addressed the recruitment of necessary expertise. 
What your morning paper did not tell you, however, was that the CIA seized a similar disc from Ayman Zawahiri's right-hand, Ahmed Salama Mabruk, 5 years earlier. 
The computer disk was confiscated from him during his arrest by the CIA in Azerbaijan and handed over to the Egyptian authorities. 
Mabruk, at the time, was the head of Jihad's military operations. 
There is a risk that observers underestimate the time that Al Qaeda has had to make progress in such recruitment and research and development. 
Some may still think that even in the final stages of the 9/11 plot, Zacarias Moussaoui was going to fly a 5th plane into the Capitol or White House. 
Others argue that he was to be part of a second wave of airliners directed to targets on the West Coast. 
There is an e-mail by Moussaoui, however, dated July 31, 2001 indicating that he sought to take a crop dusting course that was to last up to 6 months. 
In March 2003, Mohammed reportedly said that Moussaoui was not going to be part of 9/11 but was to be part of a "second wave." 
Although Ramzi Binalshibh provided him $14,000 in July, accused September 11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui told his trial judge that he had an al Qaeda mission that would have come after the terrorist attacks. 
KSM explained that Moussaoui's inquiries about crop dusters may have been related to the anthrax work being done by US-trained biochemist and Al Qaeda operative, Malaysian Yazid Sufaat. 
Zacarias Moussaoui, never the sharpest tool in the shed and thought by his superiors to be unreliable, has told the judge at his trial in a filing that he wants "anthrax for Jew sympathizer only." 
Al Qaeda's regional operative, Hambali, who was at a key January 2000 meeting and supervised Sufaat, has been captured. 
Hambali reportedly is cooperating to some degree. 
KSM and Hambali sent al-Hindi (al-Britani), along with Jafar the Pilot, to case NYC targets for a second wave. 
It was as part of that surveillance in early 2001 that Jafar the Pilot studied tourist helicopters in the NYC area. 
Sufaat, according to both KSM and Hambali, did not have the virulent US Army Ames strain that would be used. 
That would require someone who had access to the strain. 
But if experience is any guide, nothing would stand in the way of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri's decade-long quest to weaponize and use anthrax against US targets that was described by one confidante to an Egyptian newspaper reporter. 
The islamist had been released from Egyptian prison and had known Zawahiri well for many years. 
Emails from Zawahiri to Atef in the Spring of 1999 indicate that Ayman was a close student of the USAMRIID anthrax program. 
He believed that the koran instructed that a jihadist should use the weapons used by the crusader. 
"What we know is that he's always said it was a religious obligation to have the same weapons as their enemies," former CIA OBL unit counter terrorism chief Michael Scheuer has said. 
The Wall Street Journal reported that a computer used by Zawahiri contains a June 1999 memo that "said the program should seek cover and talent in educational institutions, which it said were 'more beneficial to us and allow easy access to specialists, which will greatly benefit us in the first stage, God willing.' '' 
Zawahiri was associated with a faction of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad known as the Vanguards of Conquest. 
Zawahiri and the Vanguards of Conquest were seeking to recreate Mohammed's taking of mecca by a small band through violent attacks on Egyptian leaders. 
By 1998, Zawahiri had determined that the Egyptian Islamic Jihad should focus on its struggle against the United States and hold off on further attacks against the Egyptian regime. 
A key question is how they acquired the anthrax strain first isolated by the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Lab in 1980. 
According to senior counter terrorism officials, both here and abroad, among the supporters of these militant islamists were people who blended into society and were available to act when another part of the network requested it. 
A few days before Christmas 2003, after a renewed audiotape threat by Zawahiri of attacks, to include in the US homeland, the threat level was raised to orange or "high." 
After the alert condition had long since returned to yellow, Zawahiri in late February issued another audiotape. 
He urged the President that brigades and brigades would be coming under the banner of jihad carrying death and seeking paradise. 
Zawahiri said that the US should expect another 9/11 on US soil. 
According to some reports, Zawahiri is thought by intelligence to be somewhere near the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan. 
At one time, some thought he had been spotted in Iran. 
Wherever he is, authorities need to focus on the traceable connection between him and those he or Atef recruited. 
In October 2001, did the FBI profilers know of the draft message Khalid Mohammed had on the seized laptop (from 1995) that was signed "Khalid Sheik Bojinka"? 
The letter threatened to use biochemical weapons if the blind sheik was not released. 
(Khalid Mohammed's involvement dates back to Bojinka, as does Hambali's). 
Use of biochemical weapons as blackmail and threatened retaliation for such detentions was an alternative scenario in the Bojinka planning. 
In May 2004, Patrick Hughes, Lieutenant General (Retired), Assistant Secretary for Information Analysis, Homeland Security Department testified before the 9/11 Commission. 
He explained that interrogations and other evidence revealed that Al Qaeda wanted to strike the US with a nonconventional weapon, most notably anthrax. 
The same week, the WTC head testified that while they had not received any briefing on the use of planes, they had taken steps to prepare for an attack using anthrax based on intelligence that had been received. 
Al Qaeda has had anthrax, the raw seed product in its unweaponized form, since at least 1997, when it was purchased by Bin Laden through the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ("Moro Front" or "MILF"). 
Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's #2, is head of Al Qaeda's biochemical program. 
The CIA has known of Zawahiri's plans to use anthrax for a half decade. 
The confidante and right-hand man of Dr. Ayman Zawahiri admitted that Zawahiri succeeded in obtaining anthrax and intended to use it against US targets. 
Another senior Al Qaeda member (a shura or policy-making council member no less) was working for the Egyptian intelligence services and he confirmed the report in a sworn lengthy confession. 
Even Zawahiri's attorney in 1999 said that Bin Laden and Zawahiri were likely to resort to the biological and chemical agents they possessed given the extradition pressure senior Al Qaeda leaders faced. 
A recently released islamist who had been a close associate of Zawahiri said that Zawahiri spent a decade and had made 15 separate attempts to recruit the necessary expertise to weaponize anthrax in Russia and the Middle East. 
The US Army recipe was not used, and obtaining the unprocessed Ames strain of anthrax used does not warrant the weight given it by some press accounts. 
There was lax control over the distribution of the Ames strain that was used, especially in light of the fact that transfers were not even required to be recorded prior to 1997. 
Significantly, the individual who isolated it nearly a quarter century ago (now retired), upon being contacted, does not even report that he necessarily sent the only copy of the strain to Ft. Detrick. 
Senator Patrick Leahy at a Congressional hearing in the Spring of 2002 noted that the FBI had collected the Ames strain from 20 sources. 
In Fall 2004, MSNBC, relying on an unnamed FBI spokesperson, reports that the FBI has narrowed the pool of labs known to have had Ames that was a match from 16 to 4 but cannot rule out that it was made overseas. 
Al Qaeda's anthrax production plans on Khalid Mohammed's computer did not evidence knowledge of advanced techniques in the most efficient biological weapons. 
At least according to the public comments by bioweaponeer experts William Patrick and Kenneth Alibek, under the optimal method, there is no electrostatic charge. 
In the case of the anthrax used in the mailings, there was an electrostatic charge. 
Although there was a dominance of single spores and a trillion spore concentration, there were clumps as large as 40 - 100 microns. 
(Spores must be no bigger than 5 microns to be inhalable.) 
Many point to the trillion spore concentration as extraordinary. 
It is far simpler, however, to achieve a trillion spore concentration in the production of a few grams than in industrial processing typical of a state sponsored lab. 
The "trillion spore" issue was at the heart of a lot of mistaken theories of the matter concluding that state sponsorship was necessarily indicated. 
The reported finding at Dugway undermines the argument of both the "bomb Iraq" crowd and the liberals focused on Dr. Steve Hatfill who object to US biodefense research because they view it as being useful for offensive purposes. 
USDA employee Johnelle Bryant first told us, in sensational detail, of Atta's inquiries about purchasing and retrofitting a cropduster. 
Khalid Mohammed then told interrogators that Zacarias Moussaoui's inquiries about crop dusting may have related to Yazid Sufaat's anthrax manufacturing plans. 
Although the details of the documents on Mohammed's computer may (or may not) point to possible difficulties in aerial dispersal, they are fully consistent with the product used in the anthrax mailings. 
Al Qaeda had both the means and opportunity. 
US-trained Malaysian biochemist Yazid Sufaat met with 9/11 plotters and two hijackers in January 2000. 
Sufaat was a member of Al Qaeda and a member of Jemaah Islamiah ("JI"). 
JI has ties with the Moro Front. 
Sufaat used his company called Green Laboratory Medicine to buy items useful to Al Qaeda. 
(Green symbolizes "Islam" and Prophet Mohammed's holy war). 
Zacarias Moussaoui, who had a crop dusting manual when he was arrested, stayed at Sufaat's condominium in 2000 when he was trying to arrange for flight lessons in Malaysia. 
Yazid Sufaat provided Moussaoui with a letter indicating that he was a marketing representative for Infocus Technologies and allegedly provided him $35,000. 
The crop dusters were to be part of a "second wave." 
After 9/11, Yazid Sufaat traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan to work for the Taliban Medical Brigade and to continue his work with anthrax. 
As described in US News, a former reporter from the Kabul Times actually may have met Sufaat, without realizing it, while traveling near Kabul in October 2001, perceiving him as Filipino. 
The fellow was carrying papers from Zawahiri and bragging about his ability to manipulate anthrax. 
Sufaat was arrested in December 2001 upon his return to Malaysia. 
Newsweek reported that a "second wave" involving biological attacks had been thwarted upon the arrest of Al Qaeda members who had been intended to provide logistical support. 
Various doctors, both foreign and American, are associated with Al Qaeda leaders or operatives, to include the doctors Abdul Qadoos Khan, a bacteriologist from Rawalpindi and Aafia Siddiqui, PhD, from Karachi. 
Microbiologist Abdul Qadoos Khan was charged along with his son, Ahmed, for harboring the fugitives. 
As of March 28, 2003, he was in a hospital for a cardiac problem and had been granted "pre-arrest bail." 
Yet all you read about at the time was the arrest of the son Ahmed Abdul Qadoos, who receives a stipend from the UN for being officially low-IQ due to lead poisoning. 
It was Khalid Mohammed who told authorities about Aafia Siddiqui, who has a PhD from Brandeis in neurology. 
The Pakistani press reported that she was nabbed in Karachi after being spotted at the airport in late March or early April 2003. 
If mistaken, how did those reports first come about? 
Understandably, Amerithrax is a confidential investigation. 
The Pakistan ISI and CIA rarely grant press interviews in connection with an ongoing manhunt. 
The CIA did not even allow the FBI access to KSM for 10 days after his arrest. 
As agent Van Harp, then head of the Amerithrax investigation said, the information coming from Khalid Mohammed is classified with the authorities releasing only certain limited information. 
While it's not easy to separate fact from fiction, Attorney General Ashcroft and Director Mueller have publicly confirmed Aafia is still being sought. 
They would know. 
Her mother Ismat last saw Aafia and her grandchildren before they left in a minicab at the end of March. 
Aafia was on her way with her children to visit and uncle and a friend in Islamabad. 
According to the Pakistan reports, Aafia Siddiqui was detained after being spotted at Karachi International airport (after she was followed to a relative's house). 
(Karachi is in the south). 
The reports say she is suspected of having been a member of Al Qaeda's "Chemical Wire Group." 
The family's lawyer advises me that Aafia did not have enough money to pay for airfare tickets for herself and the kids and called Ismat from the train station. 
That was the last Ismat heard from her. 
Aafia never reached the uncle's house. 
Perhaps something got lost in the translation, but the phrase "Chemical Wire Group" has appeared in all the english Pakistan and India papers. 
The family's attorney advises me that Aafia had no knowledge of chemicals (and that would not appear to be her training). 
There still is a very hot pursuit of the "Atta-level" Floridian, Adnan El Shukrijumah, who Siddiqui is thought to have known and been assisting. 
His nickname is "Jafar the Pilot." 
A senior DOJ official reports that Adnan has experience as a commercial pilot. 
He is said by one FBI agent to be "very, very, very" dangerous. 
He allegedly was at one or more meetings in the Summer of 2001 in Pakistan at which KSM and Sufaat were present. 
He may have been seen in Hamilton, Canada -- along with Egyptian al-Maati, who apparently also has received pilot training. 
The United States truly no longer has time for faulty analysis or politically-based preconceptions. 
In early June 2003, a CIA report concluded that the reason for Atta's and Zacarias Moussaoui's inquiries into cropdusters was in fact for the contemplated use in dispersing biological agents such as anthrax. 
It has long been known Osama Bin Laden was interested in using cropdusters to disperse biological agents (since the testimony of millennium bomber Ahmed Ressam). 
The hijacker Ahmed Alhaznawi appears to have contracted cutaneous anthrax in Afghanistan. 
It is reasonable to credit his statement that he got the lesion after bumping into a suitcase he was carrying at a camp in Afghanistan. 
The lesion is further evidence of Al Qaeda's anthrax production program at Kandahar. 
The present evidence relating to Atta's alleged travel to Prague does not warrant a conclusion that Al Qaeda obtained the Ames strain from Iraq. 
Iraq, however, remains a possible source of the Ames. 
Former Russian bioweaponeer Ken Alibek has said that a key Russian scientist assisted Iraq and that Russia had the Ames strain. 
(His conclusion may have been based on the fake mobile biolab plans foisted upon the US by the Chalabi associate "Curveball", which Alibek divined to be identical to Russian mobile lab design). 
Zawahiri did travel to Baghdad in 1998 with an entourage to attend the birthday party of Saddam's son. 
The papers found at headquarters of the Mukhabarat, Iraq's secret police, show that an entourage from Al Qaeda group was sent to the Iraqi capital in March 1998 from Sudan. 
According to at least some reports, Bin Laden rejected the suggestion of a closer alliance -- preferring to pursue his own concept of jihad. 
Two top Iraqi scientists, code named Charlie and Alpha, are helping the coalition to learn more about Iraqi's anthrax program, according to Dr. David Kay, head of the Iraq survey group in charge of the hunt for WMD. 
He has said that the Iraqis made surprising innovations in the milling and drying processes needed to weaponize anthrax. 
The media coverage has been seriously confused on the issue of motive and the reason Senators Daschle and Leahy would have been targeted -- tending to simplistically view them as "liberals." 
Zawahiri likely targeted Senators Daschle and Leahy to receive anthrax letters, in addition to various media outlets, because of the appropriations made pursuant to the "Leahy Law" to military and security forces. 
That money has prevented the militant islamists from achieving their goals. 
Al Qaeda members and sympathizers feel that the FBI's involvement in countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines interferes with the sovereignty of those countries. 
According to a post she made on the internet, Aafia Siddiqui expressed the same sentiment in connection with US appropriations sought in exchange for the extradition of WTC 1993 plotter Ramzi Yousef from Pakistan. 
Senator Leahy was Chairman of both the Judiciary Committee overseeing the FBI and Appropriations Subcommittee in charge of foreign aid to these countries. 
In late September 2001, it was announced that the President was seeking a blanket waiver that would lift all restrictions on aid to military and security units in connection with pursuing the militant islamists. 
This extradition and imprisonment of Al Qaeda leaders, along with US support for Israel and the Mubarak government in Egypt, remains foremost in the mind of Dr. Zawahiri. 
At the height of the development of his biological weapons program, his brother was extradited pursuant to a death sentence in the "Albanian returnees" case (now he faces retrial). 
It's hard to keep up with the stories about billion dollar appropriations, debt forgiveness, and loan guarantees to countries like Egypt and Israel and now even Pakistan. 
Those appropriations pale in comparison to the many tens of billions in appropriations relating to the invasion of Iraq. 
Al Qaeda had a motive in mind. 
In his Fall 2001 book titled Knights under the Banner of the Prophet, Zawahiri argued that the secular press was telling "lies" about the militant islamists -- to include the suggestion that the militant islamists were somehow the creation of the United States in connection with expelling the Russians from Afghanistan. 
Zawahiri argued instead that they have been active since the assassination of Anwar Sadat in Egypt because of the Camp David Accord and the resulting peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. 
The anthrax letters were sent on the date of the Camp David Accord and then the date Anwar Sadat was assassinated as if to underscore the point to anyone paying attention. 
Most of the "talking heads" on television, however, knew only that Daschle and Leahy were liberal democrats and did not know anything of Al Qaeda beyond what they read in the US newspapers. 
The FBI's profile includes a US-based supporter of the militant islamists. 
Attorney General Ashcroft explained that an "either-or" approach is not useful. 
The media has tended to overlook the fact that when the FBI uses the word "domestic" the word includes a US-based, highly-educated supporter of the militant islamists. 
There is an emerging consensus that anthrax was contained in a letter to AMI, the publisher of the National Enquirer -- in a goofy love letter to Jennifer Lopez enclosing a Star of David and proposing marriage. 
A report by the Center for Disease Control of interviews with AMI employees (as well as detailed interviews by author Leonard Cole) supports the conclusion that there were not one, but two, such mailings containing anthrax. 
(The letters were to different AMI publications -- one to the National Enquirer and another to The Sun). 
(News assistant Bobby Bender recalls the letter containing the items to have been addressed to The Sun.) 
This tactic of letters is not merely the modus operandi of these militant islamists inspired by Zawahiri, it is their signature. 
The islamists sent letter bombs in January 1997 to newspaper offices in New York City and Washington, D.C.. 
They were sent in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center and the imprisonment of the blind sheik, Sheik Abdel Rahman. 
The former leader of the Egyptian Al-Gamaa al-Islamiya ("Islamic Group"), he was also a spiritual leader of Al Qaeda. 
The letter bombs were sent in connection with the treatment of the Egyptian islamists imprisoned for the earlier attack on the WTC and a related plot. 
The purpose of the letter bombs -- which resulted in minimal casualty -- was to send a message. 
(There initially was an outstanding $2 million reward -- under the rewards for justice program, the reward now is up to $5 million.). 
There was no claim of responsibility. 
There was no explanation. 
Once one had been received, the next ten, mailed on two separate dates, were easily collected. 
Sound familiar? 
Two bombs were also sent to Leavenworth, where a key WTC 1993 defendant was imprisoned, addressed to "Parole Officer." 
(The position does not exist). 
Abdel Rahman's son was captured in Quetta, Pakistan in mid-February 2003. 
That arrest in turn led to the dramatic capture of Khalid Mohammed, Al Qaeda's #3. 
Mohammed allegedly was hiding in the home of the Pakistani bacteriologist Dr. Abdul Qadoos Khan. 
Along with Zawahiri, Abdel Rahman and his two sons have had considerable influence over Bin Laden. 
He reportedly treated them like sons. 
Although while in jail in the early 1980s, Zawahiri caused considerable tension by challenging the blind sheik's ability to lead a coalition of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Egyptian Islamic Group, Zawahiri and OBL are Rahman's friends. 
The imprisoned WTC 1993 plotter Yousef was KSM's nephew. 
Thus, the leaders in charge of Al Qaeda's anthrax production program had a close connection to those imprisoned in connection with the earlier bombing of the World Trade Center. 
According to the controversial "Feith memo," which summarized purported intelligence showing an Iraqi/Al Qaeda connection, Osama Bin Laden had asked Iraqi intelligence for technical assistance in sending letter bombs a half year before the Al Hayat letters were sent. 
Just because Al Qaeda likes its truck bombs and the like to be effective does not mean they do not see the value in a deadly missive. 
As Brian Jenkins once said, "terrorism is theater." 
A sender purporting to be islamist sent cyanide in both early 2002 and early 2003 in New Zealand and ingredients of nerve gas in Belgium in 2003. 
There's even a chapter titled "Poisonous Letter" in the Al Qaeda manual. 
The "Federal Eagle" stamp used in the anthrax mailings was a blue-green. 
It was widely published among the militant islamists that martyrs go to paradise "in the hearts of green birds." 
In the very interview in which they admitted 9/11, and described the codes used for the four targets for the planes, the masterminds admitted to the Jenny code, the code for representing the date 9/11, and used the symbolism of the "Green Birds." 
Osama Bin Laden later invoked the symbolism in his video "The 19 Martyrs." 
A FAQ on the Azzam Publications website explained that "In the Hearts of Green Birds" refers to what is inside. 
The mailer's use of "Greendale School" as the return address for the letters to the Senators is also revealing. 
A May 2001 letter that Zawahiri sent to Egyptian Islamic Jihad members abroad establish that Zawahiri used "school" as a code word for the Egyptian militant islamists in his correspondence. 
Green symbolizes Islam and was the Prophet Mohammed's color. 
By Greendale School, the anthrax perp was being cute, just as Yazid Sufaat was being cute in naming his lab Green Laboratory Medicine. 
"Dale" means "river valley." 
Greendale likely refers to green river valley -- i.e., Cairo's Egyptian Islamic Jihad or the Islamic Group. 
The sender probably is announcing that he is of either Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Egyptian Islamic Group or Jihad-al Qaeda, which is actually the full name of the group after the merger of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda. 
At the Darunta complex where jihadis trained, recruits would wear green uniforms, except for Friday when they were washed. 
In a Hadith the Messenger of Allah explains that the souls of the martyrs are in the hearts of green birds that fly wherever they please in the Paradise. 
As to opportunity, though seldom reported, there is a wealth of "open source" information about possible Al Qaeda or Egyptian Islamic Jihad or Egyptian Islamic Group in the United States and Canada. 
The public information mostly relates to those suspected sleepers who have been detained or who are at large and are being sought. 
Zawahiri's mission in the United States in 1995 was to do spadework for terrorism, not fundraising for charitable causes. 
He traveled under an alias and was accompanied by a former US Army sergeant named Ali Mohammed. 
What mosques exactly did they visit and who did they meet? 
Whatever your political persuasion, the FBI and CIA deserve our support. 
We are, after all, in this together. 
First, the nature of such an investigation is that we lack sufficient information to second-guess (or even know) what the FBI is doing. 
Media reports are a poor approximation of reality because of the lack of good sources. 
Second, hindsight is 20/20. 
Third, with the "new age" Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. in charge of the investigation, it is not likely we could do better in striking the appropriate balance between due process and national security. 
Finally, the "Hatfill theory" seems to have been exhausted or at least lost public favor. 
The "Hatfill theory" accusing Dr. Stephen Hatfill was always highly dubious. 
The suspicion was founded on many false premises, and there was no reliable publicly known evidence indicating his guilt. 
The FBI's fixation on Hatfill (at least as rumored by some reporters) may have stemmed from a warning by one Senator that careers hung in the balance. 
Leahy's chief of staff apparently started with the strong predisposition that some right-winger was involved because two liberal democrats had been targeted. 
The Hatfill theory -- to include ongoing interviews and ongoing 7/24 surveillance by 8 surveillance specialists -- is now the subject of pending civil rights and libel claims of uncertain merit. 
A suit against the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof was dismissed in late November 2004. 
The judge had agreed to delay the civil rights matter from proceeding until at least October 2004. 
The judge, frustrated by the apparent lack of progress, encouraged that the parties reach a negotiated compromise that would permit some limited discovery to proceed (and the judge has directed that the government to file an Answer to the Complaint). 
The Hatfill Theory ironically might best be understood as an Al Qaeda theory, with a coincidental Malaysian connection adding to the other circumstances. 
Given the regrettable leaks that he was under suspicion, it is only fair that the FBI leak with equal enthusiasm the fact that Dr. Hatfill has now been dropped as a suspect if and when that proves to be the case. 
A search of Dr. Ken Berry's residences likely will prove just about the last gasp of a biodefense insider theory. 
Senior officials have been quoted in the press as saying that the searches were for the purpose of excluding him as much as including him.
