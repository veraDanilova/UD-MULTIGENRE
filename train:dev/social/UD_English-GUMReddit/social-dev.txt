ELI5: 
If every major country is in billions (if not trillions) of debt, where are they borrowing from? 
You can borrow from your own people. 
The money that is printed is FEDERAL RESERVE (thanks for the corrections) notes -- it's technically a debt that the Reserve owes the bearer of the note (but printing money does not technically increase the debt supply -- the role of money has changed since fiat currency). 
When you print more money, you are devaluing the rest of the currency that is already in circulation. 
This means that if the govt decided to print $ 100,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quadrillion dollars) in the span of a week, the value of the dollar would probably crash pretty hard (probably ...). 
This is related because people use money to buy US debt -- we're loaning the US govt the very money it prints. 
The only reason that this results in anything favorable is because people all over the world value USD and that paper currency represents potential labor, new assets, etc. 
If you own a baseball card of Sammy Sosa, there is a chance it could be worth a lot of money. 
Now imagine if the card company just mails a Sammy Sosa card to every family in America. 
Your Sammy Sosa card isn't worth anything anymore because there are so many of them and everyone has it now. 
Now imagine if they mailed another 5 to everyone -- the value crashes even harder because there are SO many of them now. 
That's the same idea with money. 
You can't keep printing more money or else the value of it will deteriorate. 
But the gov't keeps issuing more debt and we still look at $ 20 like it's $ 20, right? 
Eventually, there could come a time when we look at a $ 20 bill and it means nothing to us. 
This is what happened in Zimbabwe where a billion dollar transaction might happen for a loaf of bread. 
They printed so much money (without proper secure backing by the gov't) that it just became worthless. 
So they started to just increase the numbers on their currency so you can actually pay for something. 
Because the gov't theoretically owes its population money, they issue paper as a certificate of this. 
You might not have physically went to the bank and traded something in return for paper but you did something that warranted the earning of that dollar. 
If you work for a company, they pay you that money because it has value and you can buy things with it. 
The only reason it has value is because the US gov't says it does. 
You can pay gov't-related fees and bills with the money they issue and because the gov't is well-secured, people accept it. 
If our gov't was unstable, no one would trust the dollars they slept under for warmth because the gov't could just come out and say, 'Sorry we're not paying you guys back'. 
Well what would they be paying back? 
To whom are they paying back to? 
It used to be gold. 
But as we grew as a planet, we ran out of gold to back every dollar with and it just became a nightmare to handle. 
Enter, fiat currency, a piece of paper that means nothing except what the gov't says it means. 
People used to go to banks with gold and receive 'money' for it. 
The banks would literally hold their gold and give them an certificate that says they own a claim of gold in their vaults. 
If ANYONE brought that certificate to the bank, they could expect to receive gold for it. 
That's what gave it value. 
You could say you want that farmer's potatoes and he can go get $ 1 of gold from the bankers at his convenience or he could hold onto it and use it just like the person did before him -- 'trade' it for something else like new shoes. 
Why? 
Because everyone liked gold and everyone believed gold had value. 
Eventually, this took off and people stopped trading for things and we developed currency with quantitative values that allowed for easy exchanges to take place. 
So you might think,' Well, now that there isn't gold behind my dollar, how is it worth anything even if the gov't say it is? They won't give me anything in return for it". 
The same thing applies to gold. 
No one wants gold unless other people want gold. 
If you can't reasonably trade your gold for something else, then what value does it have? 
(Someone did point out you can shave gold flakes into your water and drink it, like some companies have chosen to do, but that's on you) 
As long as people continue to value dollars, it doesn't matter what it's worth, sans some certain supply and demand laws. 
So gold is no different in that regard. 
The ONE difference between paper currency and gold is that $ 100,000 in cash weighs a lot less than $ 100,000 in gold and is a lot easier to hide too. 
EDIT: 
I made some slight revisions to correct errors and to try and relate things better to the main topic at hand. 
Sorry, I kinda started rambling. 
I have also posted below in response to u/penny_eater to correct my errors and explain them in a little bit further detail but it kinda strays away from ELI5 territory. 
This kinda seems all over the place but it should be good starter information for someone trying to understand debt markets and macroeconomics, in general. 
Monetary supply and debt are pretty hand-in-hand, even if they're not exactly the same thing. 
Larger and more complex economies warranted the development of fiat currency which ultimately changed the role of currency, in general. 
It no longer represents a claim, per se, but it represents value because the gov't says it has value and will accept it for gov't related transactions and business with foreign entities. 
Also, don't get me started on the petrodollar. 
Humans are the only species on earth to try and stop themselves from reproducing 
Pandas do a fine job of avoiding reproduction, too. 
The lazy bastards. 
I read a good source (another reddit comment) which stated that pandas being notoriously poor at reproducing is a myth. 
It's just that getting any species in captivity to reproduce is a challenge, so that's why getting pandas in captivity to reproduce is a challenge too. 
And in the wild they would reproduce just fine, the largest threat to their reproduction is the narrowing of their ecosystems by humans, not their poor talent in reproducing. 
It's true. 
Zoos in China with larger panda populations also have far fewer problems getting them to breed. 
A little bit of male competition really helps. 
Yup ... here it is 
In times of poor food availability, white tail deer stop/slow reproduction. 
I assume that it also happens elsewhere. 
There was an experiment that was done with a rat population which was raised in an environment of artificial high abundance of food, water, etc. 
The population grew rapidly until space became scarce, then many of the rats exhibited complete disinterest in sex/reproduction which persisted even as population size decreased, causing a collapse of the rat society. 
(IIRC) 
Behavioral Sink 
And dolphins 
Schooled him 
Ha what a blow hole 
Nah they’re pod people. 
I love all these comments telling OP he's wrong. 
I think I read that if food was low, rabbits will abort their young and reabsorb them. 
We're the only animal that does it consciously. 
That we know of. 
But to be fair, we're the only animal that does anything consciously which involves deep planning. 
That we know of. 
Plot twist: cats are the smartest species on earth and will overthrow humans when we realize that we’re their servants. 
... and for good reason. 
What about the Ai currently proliferating through our computer networks? 
Don't they count??? 
WHERE IS YOUR HEART?!?! 
We’re too fucking good at it. 
How would we know? 
Perhaps other species went extinct because they stopped reproducing. 
But did they do so planningly? 
And eating 
But we still like to practice. 
I think it's coyotes that will howl at certain times and listen for responses to decide if an area is over populated. 
Not sure if that means they go somewhere else to hump or just stay where they are and don't hump. 
In our defense human babies are the worst of all the species. 
How would we know that they didn’t? 
It’s not to prove that they did, just stating that the option is there. 
It’s not provable or unprovable. 
Yeah other animals just eat their babies 
This has to do with the fact that raising our offspring is labor and resource intensive. 
Many species can walk minutes after birth. 
Due to the size of our heads and the limited size of the birth canal, humans are born relatively premature. 
Those children then have to be taken care of for years before they can even begin to fend for themselves. 
This is even more pronounced in prosperous societies where only one or two children are even needed and we can legitimately afford not to make children work.
