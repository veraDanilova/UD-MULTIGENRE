Like you said "the kids egg him on". 
maybe too much . 
Sounds like your cat is stressed out . 
Maybe he doesn't want to play when they want to.. 
He didn't take a dislike to the kids for "no" reason! 
cats react to the treatment they receive, they are not toys. 
maybe the cat needs a "new' home.........

Hello dear list members, 
The multiple planetary afflictions are taking their toll. 
Currently, Mercury and Venus is conjunct and the conjunction is being closely aspected by Rahu. 
In Pakistan national chart besides the transit affliction to transit Venus in the fourth house by FMs Rahu and Mercury, natal Saturn and Venus are also under the close affliction of transit Rahu. 
This has resulted in a major rail accident in Pakistan involving three trains and involving more than 300 deaths. 
In Indian national chart besides the transit affliction to transit Mercury by Rahu and Venus the natal Saturn and Venus are also under the transit affliction of Rahu which has resulted into floods in many parts of the country taking toll of human lives, properties, etc.

Frequent travelers and executives are among the masses that get a lot of discount in the airfare. 
It is easy to get discount airfare for them since they travel very frequently. 
Cheap air tickets for Corporate

Several years ago I developed a short paper and pencil screening test which, in a small pilot study, discriminated between ADHD, LD, and control subjects. 
I recently converted this test to an online test in order to norm it to a larger population and, subsequently, to make it available to any one who has access to a computer and the Internet. 
The test itself is what is called a substitution test. 
It has two parts, both of which are timed for 90 seconds each and the differential between the resulting two scores determines the likelihood of having a learning disability or attention deficit disorder. 
I am in need of test subjects and hope you will take it. 
The test, along with an information form, is available at: . 
I think a test like this one is much needed. 
A person can take it directly instead of others completing behavioral checklists or a completing a lengthy program intensive test like TOVA. 
Perhaps you are willing to recommend this site and, if you have a website, place a link on your website. 
are there any sadists out there who share the same tastes as i do ? 
i dont know what it is , but since a very young age i have had a strange but very gratifying urge to torture or maime animals. 
i am deadly serious, i really do get sexual releif from even hearing of torture of animals, now some people may call me a brute or a coward but i cant help my true feelings. 
badger baiting is natrually a huge turn on, so i thought a few words in this group might uncover some mutual enthusiasts. 
sincere appologies to anyone who is offended by my request but my request is genuine.

Greetings. 
My name is Bill Gottlieb: 
I'm a freelance journalist specializing in health, with 30 years experience. 
I'm the author of three books (including the 1.3 million seller ALTERNATIVE CURES) and hundreds of magazine articles, and worked for 20 years at Rodale Press, as a writer and as editor-in-chief of Prevention and Rodale Books. 
Currently, I am writing a book on natural supplements to aid weight loss, with Harry Preuss, MD, a Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University; it is scheduled for publication by Broadway (Random House) in January 2007. 
I am seeking anecdotes (first name, last initial) from dieters who successfully used a natural supplement to assist their weight loss; the therapeutic agents under discussion include HCA, MCT, green or oolong tea extract, CLA, chromium, starch-blockers, chitosan, 5-HTP, hoodia and caralluma, HMB, and BCAA. 
If you've successfully used any of these supplement to aid weight loss, please write me at gottlie...@yahoo.com and let me know, telling me about your experience. 
Thank you for your time and attention. 
Warm regards, 
Bill Gottlieb 
Once upon a time (in 2001, to be specific), the Coca-Cola corporation built a bottling plant in a small and remote Indian village in the state of Kerala. 
In exchange for sucking vast amounts of water out of the local land, the mighty corporation promised to bring the people great wealth. 
But within a few short months, the village people began to notice their wells were running dry, so they complained to the corporation. 
Coca-Cola calmed the concerns of the people and attempted to win back their favor by giving them vast amounts of free fertilizer, saying it would grow bountiful crops beyond their wildest dreams. 
After several years of use, we arrive at the present day when the village people have suddenly discovered the fertilizer is actually the bottling plant's waste sludge and is laden with cadmium, a highly toxic, cancer-causing heavy metal. 
The village soil and water are now too heavily contaminated to safely occupy human life, so the plant was shut down last week. 
Moral of the story: Don't drink Coke..........drink Pepsi! 
Just kidding, Pepsi is actually in the process of being thrown out of India for similar crimes, as well. 
The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center (GNOFHAC) filed a housing discrimination complaint against the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) last week. 
The complaint, filed with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, accuses HANO of violating a 2003 enforcement agreement entered into between former St. Thomas Housing Development residents, the City of New Orleans, HANO, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development during the HOPE VI redevelopment of St. Thomas, now known as River Garden. 
The current complaints allege that HANO has not provided qualified former St. Thomas residents a preference with respect to available public housing units at River Garden per the 2003 agreement. 
Upon return to New Orleans after the Hurricane Katrina evacuation, former residents have been informed that there are no available public housing units at River Garden because those units have been reserved for HANO employees. 
Therefore, public housing residents have been unable to secure the units for which they qualified prior to the storm and are left homeless, as a result. 
"In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, affordable housing in New Orleans is more scarce than ever. 
As such, it is essential that HANO comply with 2003 enforcement agreement," said James Perry, GNOFHAC Executive Director 
Crude-oil prices rose Wednesday as strengthening Hurricane Rita, now a Category 5 storm, threatened to disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. 
New York's main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in November rose 60 cents to close at 66.80 dollars per barrel. 
In London, the price of Brent North Sea crude for November delivery advanced 53 cents to 64.73 dollars. 
After brushing the Florida Keys islands on Tuesday, Rita packed winds of about 240 kilometers an hour as it headed across the Gulf of Mexico. 
The US National Hurricane Center said Rita was "extremely dangerous" and could become a top-level category five storm on the Saffir-Simpson scale. 
The storm threatened oil installations in the Gulf of Mexico where about one-quarter of US oil operations are based. 
Oil companies evacuated offshore facilities as the storm's progress kept global markets on tenterhooks. 
In Texas, BP shut its 460,000 barrels per day refinery and Marathon shut its 72,000 bpd plant. 
Valero said it was reducing rates at its 243,000 bpd Texas City refinery and its 85,000 bpd Houston refinery. 
Exxon Mobil released nonessential staff from two giant Texas plants. 
Last month, Katrina devastated refineries in Louisiana and Mississippi and sent prices to a record high of 70.85 dollars a barrel.

NASA is looking to private companies to launch both supplies and astronauts to the International Space Station, it announced this week. 
[...] 
"It's not cost-effective doing station flights while at the same time focusing on getting back to the Moon," says Brett Alexander, vice-president of Transformational Space, one of the companies hoping to launch astronauts to the ISS. 
NASA intends upon retiring the space shuttles in 2010, which only leaves it with 18 flights towards the ISS. 
Outsourcing these responsibilities would be a wise alternative, considering the accomplishments of the private sector regarding the space elevator . 
Although some may praise this as an opportunity for the private sector to finally serve the public good, NASA seems hesitant about turning over the reigns to the corporate world. 
(New Scientist Space) 
On 3 November, NASA administrator Michael Griffin told the US house science committee that the agency expects to invest about $500 million in the commercial cargo and crew project over five years. 
"That kind of a financial incentive [...] will be sufficient to allow substantial providers to emerge," Griffin said. 
"I hope that industry, if put to the test, can do better [than the government], but I do not expect it," Griffin added. 
Only time will reveal whether Griffin's expectations are either exceeded or confirmed. 
But seeing how the private sector has been able to successfully transport civilians to the ISS (at about a fifth of the cost), it would come to no surprise if corporate America was able to out perform their bureaucratic friends in government.

Normally this author is semi-objective (what blogger is) but on the Seattlepi.com (see source link) Palestinian Leader Mahmoud Abbas has demanded that Israel leave all the land that it occupies before the 1967 border (which includes East Jerusalem by the way). 
One thing is certain for sure. 
If Abbas keeps up this "macho talk" he will kill potential peace talks and might as well allow Hamas (which has probably done a better job at providing for the Palestinians) rule the West Bank. 
AP Photo/Nasser Nasser 
Interim Palestinian leader and the front-runner in the upcoming Jan. 9, 2005 presidential election Mahmoud Abbas talks during his first official campaign speech in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Saturday Dec. 25, 2004. 
Cloaking himself in Yasser Arafat's legacy, Abbas pledged to fulfill Palestinian dreams of statehood. 
It seems that the Palestinian leadership (upcoming) will not be a peace partner with Israel. 
He is already demanding claims that Israel said no to not only the world, but to Arafat himself. 
Listing his priorities, Abbas told supporters of the ruling Fatah party that he was determined to provide security to his people and continue the struggle against Israel's partially completed West Bank barrier. 
Abbas also pledged to resolve the problem of millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants. 
Abbas, a refugee himself from what is today the northern Israeli city of Safed, called the refugee issue "very important and very dangerous." 
Having personally visited the West Bank and Israel, I can say that this new political voice is threatening to collapse the peace process. 
If Abbas does not change his former thinking and continues the path of Yasser Arafat, then there will not be peace in the Holy Land and the Palestinians will ultimately suffer. 
Selah!

(Hat Tip: Captains Quarters ) 
(BBC) 
The Palestinian militant organisation Hamas has announced an end to rocket attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip after a weekend of escalating violence. 
Up to 40 rockets had been fired at Israel, weeks after its military withdrew from the territory. 
In response to the rockets, Israel resumed its policy of targeting militant leaders in air strikes. 
Authorised by Ariel Sharon to make "unrestricted" strikes, its military launched new missile attacks overnight. 
It looks as if Hamas has thrown in the towel for this round, unable to take the beating the Israeli Defense Forces have unleashed upon this terrorist group. 
Mahmoud Zahar, Hamas's leader declared the cease fire after Israel killed it's former leader, Muhammed Sheikh Khalil . 
Hamas has become rather unpopular in Gaza, as many see the Israeli air strikes as a response towards the rocket attacks upon Israeli soil. 
Egypt had a role to play as they convinced Hamas to end the attacks, although the same can not be said of Islamic Jihad . 
(Jerusalem Post) 
"We're not happy with Hamas's position at this stage and in light of the Israeli escalation against the Palestinians," commented Khader Habib, a senior Islamic Jihad official. 
"But it seems that Hamas has its own political agenda." 
[...] 
"The problem is not with the Palestinian resistance groups but with Israel's scheme to destroy the Palestinians' infrastructure," Habib said. 
"Hamas remains targeted by Israel, as in the past, and the Israeli occupation does not need excuses to pursue its aggression. 
Israel wants to drive the Palestinians toward civil war." 
Islamic Jihad has refused to recognized the cease fire, and hopes to turn the Gaza strip "into a vast battlefield." 
Unless President Mahmoud Abbas steps in, Gaza will probably look like a battle field by the time Israel is done reminding Hamas of their critical error, although currently the only thing Abbas is doing is lashing out and refusing to take responsibility for his inability to act.
