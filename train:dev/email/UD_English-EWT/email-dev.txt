Fucking bitches!"

All: 
It is my understanding, from good sources in the Govs office that the Gov will order Loretta Lynch to expeditiously implement the provision to suspend all parties auhtority to enter into direct access contracts. 
The premise with which the administartion is acting is that if they expeditiously suspend everyone's right to bilateral contracts quickly, it sets up a barrier which the direct access coalition must break through. 
In other words the table is set. 
Deal your meal from where the dishes are located. 
I.E. the Davis Administration wants to place all direct access advocates in the position of having to justify why each and every party should be the exception to the suspension rather than have a general rule concerning how direct access should work for all parties. 
It clearly gives the Admin a very strong upper hand to control who when and where direct access can occur without having to say that they oppose direct access. 
Power be where power lies. 
you aren't going in for the wedding until sunday now? 
I'm in

I spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP. 
Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA. 
However, he also mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the fifth highest bid. 
He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid. 
He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure. 
NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter, I believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP. 
Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP. 
Thanks,

On or about September 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above referenced counterparty. 
The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement. 
These agreements were forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc.. 
On or about October 6, 1999, Kelly Cloud, Senior Vice President of CCNG, Inc. (713) 235-1972, called and informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM, L.P.. 
Further, she informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads in part: Gas is free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or is subject to liens. 
She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of Section 7. 
Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7. 
Kelly 
Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions. 
Thanks.

How is your love life. 
The gal from the wedding was pretty hot. 
Are you still chasing that? 
Lets get together soon.

Glad to hear all is well. 
I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses. 
It isn't about finding the meaning of life at work. 
It is all about the $$$. 
Work hard. 
Make $$$. 
Retire young. 
Things with me are great. 
Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go. 
Take care. 
I don't hear from you in months and then you level me with such a thought provoking, soul searching article. 
Thanks for thinking of me to send it to. 
I really enjoyed reading it. 
We certainly fit into certain parts of the article. 
There are a few life theories like that which working through. 
Its all interesting stuff. 
How are things going with you? 
Are you enjoying Houston? 
London has been great. 
Brokering over here has been pretty rewarding. 
Traders over here seem to have a lot more respect for other humans. 
Catriona is well and has landed herself a pretty cool job in PR. 
Keep in touch,

I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle. 
I might just sell the car and get you to drive me around all winter. 
How about skidoo skis for the front and tracks for the back..

Jackass. 
You have always been on the move seeking affectionate, satisfying and harmonious relationships. 
Your ultimate goal has been the realisation of an intimate union in which there could be love, self-sacrifice and mutual trust. 
It has often been said that "True love is just around the corner"...and maybe... if you haven't found it as yet - you possibly soon will. 
In the past there have been .. and maybe there still are many things that you have had to do without. 
You have now decided to set your sights on a position or situation that could give you greater prestige and which will afford you considerable self esteem. 
You wear your heart on your sleeve ... and since you are an emotional person you are apt to give your all ... heart and soul ... to all those that show you a little affection ... but take care... it would appear that you have been extremely hurt in the past...and you keep leaving yourself wide open for punishment.. 
Whatever you strive to do, something always seems to be holding you back. 
There is no subterfuge in you. 
You are a clear thinker and all you demand from life, in a relationship, is a partner whom you can trust and with whom you can, together, develop a foundation of trust based on understanding. 
You are your own person... and you demand freedom of thought ...to follow your own convictions. 
You have no interest in "two-timing" and all you seek is sincerity and "straight-dealing". 
You wish to be left in peace... no more conflict and no more differences of opinion ... 
In fact you just don't want to be involved in any arguments of any shape or form ... 
All you want is for "them" to get on with it - and to leave you alone.. 
John, 
sorry for not sending it to you earlier (totally forgot to open my outlook).

Dear All, 
My mane is Visit Phunnarungsi. 
I used to e-mail Vince Kaminski about the advice on his article "The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity Derivatives" and he had mailed me the copy. 
I am now modelling the Queensland electricity spot price using Geometric Brownian Mean Reverting Jump Diffusion Model and have followed your paper "Making the most of mean reversion" to estimate the mean reversion speed. 
I use Queensland half-hourly price during 13 December, 1998-30 June 2001 giving about 44,000 price observations. 
However, the result from Ordinary Least Squares was not as expected due to different sign for both slope & intercept. 
The coefficient and standard error are as followed: 
Intercept: -0.3931 (0.0076) 
Slope: 0.1171 (0.0022) 
R Square: 0.0585 
Therefore I could not estimate the mean reversion rate as the estimated slope has the positive sign. 
I have also tried monthly data and the results are the same. 
It would be appreciated if you could advice me on this matter.

Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group. 
Right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year. 
Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer. 
What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis, who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer. 
When we start the summer process, we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group. 
Is this okay with you? 
Hope all is well with you 
Take Care 
Traci 
Traci, 
I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday. 
One of the students indicated that he is interested in a summer internship. 
He came across as a very bright person, very personable. 
I can take him as a summer intern.

Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski, 
Hi. 
How are you doing? 
I hope you have a good flight back to home. 
It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector. 
Thank you for your time. 
I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk. 
However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. 
Those attachments are what I was asked. 
Again, it was a good chance for me to get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on in school. 
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day. 
Thank you.

I would like to have a meeting to go over the payment methodology.

Please let me know what time we could meet. 
Thank you,

Phillip, 
This section pertains to terminated employees who are paid out in the year following the termination event. 
The way the tax law works, the tax basis for your share distribution will be based on the closing stock price the day preceding notification to the transfer agent. 
As such, we will distribute net shares calculating the proper withholding at fair market value the day prior to notifying the transfer agent. 
We will be distributing the shares reflected on your 9/30/01 statement (6,606 shares plus cash for fractional shares). 
If you would prefer to settle the taxes with a personal check, we can distribute gross shares. 
Please let me know you preference. 
As you know, we are in the process of transferring recordkeeping services from NTRC to Hewitt. 
As such, we have a CPA, Larry Lewis, working with us to audit and set up transition files. 
He has become our department expert on the PSA account (much more knowledgeable than myself) and the various plan provision amendments. 
If you would like, we can set up a conference call with you, myself, and Larry to go over the payment methodology. 
Please let me know a date and time that is convenient for you. 
Thanks, 
Renee 
Renee, 
Thank you for digging in to the issue of Deferred Phantom Stock Units. 
It is clear that the payment will be made in shares. 
However, I still don't understand which date will be used to determine the value and calculate how many shares. 
The plan document under VII. 
Amount of Benefit Payments reads "The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock." 
Can you help me interpret this statement and work through the numbers on my account. 
Thank you, 
Phillip Allen 
Let me know when you get the quotes from Pauline. 
I am expecting to pay something in the $3,to $5,000 range. 
I would like to see the quotes and a description of the work to be done. 
It is my understanding that some rock will be removed and replaced with siding. 
If they are getting quotes to put up new rock then we will need to clarify. 
Jacques is ready to drop in a dollar amount on the release. 
If the negotiations stall, it seems like I need to go ahead and cut off the utilities. 
Hopefully things will go smoothly.

Jim, 
Take a look at this spreadsheet. 
I tried to calculate the IRR on the port Aransas and Roma post offices. 
Is this how your clients usually evaluate these properties? 
The Roma deal looks much better.

Mery, 
This sounds better than the limitations you were describing in the meeting. 
We should be able to work with this.
