Athens (Greek: Αθήνα, Athína), is the capital city of Greece with a metropolitan population of 3.7 million inhabitants. 
It is in many ways the birthplace of Classical Greece, and therefore of Western civilization. 
Understand 
Old Athens 
The first pre-historic settlements was constructed in 3000 BC around the hill of Acropolis. 
The legend says that the King of Athens, Theseus unified the ten tribes of early Athens into one kingdom (c. 1230 BC). 
This process of synoikismos – bringing together in one home – created the largest and wealthiest state on the Greek mainland, but it also created a larger class of people excluded from political life by the nobility. 
By the 7th century BC, social unrest had become widespread, and the Areopagus appointed Draco to draft a strict new law code (hence "draconian"). 
When this failed, they appointed Solon, with a mandate to create a new constitution (594). 
This was the great beginning of a new social revolution, which was the result of the democracy under Clisthenes (508 BC). 
During the Middle Ages, Athens experienced a decline, but re-emerged under Byzantian rule. 
Athens was thriving and prosperous during the Crusades, actually benefiting from the Italian trade during this period. 
However, this fruitful period was short-lived, as Greece suffered badly under the Ottoman Empire, only to recover in the 19th century as the capital of independent Greece. 
Modern Olympic Games 
Athens hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. 
While most of the sporting venues were located outside the city proper - in various locations throughout Attica - the entire urban area of Athens underwent major lasting changes that have improved the quality of life for visitors and residents alike. 
Aside from the excellent transportation infrastructure that was completed in time for the 2004 Olympics (from new freeways to light rail systems), the city's historic center underwent serious renovation. 
Most notable among the city's facelift projects are the Unification of Archaeological Sites - which connects the city's classical - era ruins and monuments to each other through a network of pleasant pedestrianized streets - and the restoration of the picturesque neoclassical Thissio and Pláka districts. 
The ancient Olympic Games took place in Olympia from 776 BCE to 394 AD. 
It is a lengthy day trip from Athens to visit Olympia, but quite interesting. 
Architecture 
Athens was just a small provincial village when it was chosen in the 1830s to serve as the national capital of the modern Greek State. 
Although it had a prestigious past, the city's political, economic, and cultural importance had declined over the centuries, leaving behind only its classical ruins as a reminder of better times. 
With the decision to move the national capital from Nafplio to Athens, architects and city planners were hired to build a new city next to the classical ruins, with grand neoclassical homes and public buildings, large city squares, green spaces, and wide avenues, making a conscious, decisive turn from the city's Ottoman past. 
The city regained its importance in Greek civilization, and by 1900 had evolved into a very attractive cosmopolitan city, with abundant neoclassical architecture harking to the nation's past. 
The 20th century however, marked the rapid development of Athens. 
The city suffered minor damage during WWII, and suffered extensive urban planning in the decades that followed, as the nation rapidly industrialized and urbanized. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, many 19th century neoclassical buildings, often small and private, were demolished to make way for office buildings, often designed by great Greek architects. 
The city also expanded outward through rash development, particularly towards the west, as its population grew by absorbing job-seekers from the provinces. 
With the onset of the automobile, public officials reduced the city's public transportation services without foreseeing the traffic gridlock and smog that would menace the city by the 1980s. 
By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the city's reality led to a rude awakening among local and national officials and, coupled with the country's new found remarkable prosperity, large scale projects began to slowly regenerate the city and undo some of the damages of recent decades. 
Over the course of the next 15 years, money was poured into new transportation infrastructure projects, the restoration of surviving neoclassical buildings, the gentrification of the city's historical center and the renovation of many former industrial areas and the city's coastline. 
The restoration of charming neoclassical buildings in the city's historical center has been accompanied by the construction of attractive post-modern buildings in newer districts; both of which have begun to improve the aesthetic essence of the city. 
Athens today is ever evolving, forging a brand new identity for the 21st century. 
Climate 
Spring and late autumn are the best times to visit Athens. 
Summer can be extremely hot and dry during heatwaves, but this rarely happens. 
Winter is definitely low season, with the occasional rainy or snowy day, but also an ideal time to save money while enjoying the city without countless other travelers and tourists. 
Whilst peak traffic hour can be a bit smoggy on the main roads, on most sunny days the skies are azure blue. 
The main reason attributed for the pollution of Athens is because the city is enclosed by mountains in a basin which does not let the smog leave. 
The government's ban on diesel vehicles within Athens and the early 1990s initiatives to improve car emissions have greatly contributed to better atmospheric conditions in the basin. 
Coron 
Coron is in the province of Palawan, Philippines on Busuanga Island. 
It is the largest town on the island and has the largest share of accommodations. 
Background 
Coron is both the name of the largest town on the island of Busuanga, and the name of a different, smaller island just offshore. 
The area is famous for its World War II wreck diving, and the site has been named in many lists of top dive spots in the world. 
In September 1944, a fleet of Japanese ships hiding in the harbor were sunk in a daring raid by the US navy. 
The result is around ten well preserved underwater shipwrecks surrounded with coral reef. 
There are also attractions on Coron Island itself. 
There are many beautiful white sand beaches, mostly tiny and surrounded by large limestone cliffs and wildlife. 
Barracuda and Kayangan lakes are both stunning locations, and good for snorkeling, and the island is the ancestral domain of an indigenous tribe who are managing the island in a sustainable way and keeping outsiders at a distance and offshore at night. 
History 
The first inhabitants of Coron were the Tagbanuas who belong to the second wave of Indonesians who migrated to this area some 5,000 years ago. 
They were a nomadic, seafaring people, living mainly by fishing and subsistence agriculture. 
Although they are now sedentary (with the young using cell phones, etc.), they maintain many of their old customs, traditions and beliefs. 
Today, the Tagbanuas remain the dominant if not entire population of Coron. 
In 1902 that Coron was registered as a town and the name of the town was officially changed from Penon de Coron to Coron. 
From 1939 to the outbreak of World War II, the municipality experienced the mining boom. 
Labor shifted from farming to mining. 
In July 1942 the Japanese occupied the mining camps and resumed operation of the manganese mines. 
On September 24, 1944, a group of Japanese ships were sunk by American warplanes in Coron waters as the ships retreated from Manila Bay. 
To this day, about 10 or 12 of these World War II Japanese shipwrecks comprise what is considered one of the best dive sites in the world. 
In 1947, large scale deep sea fishing was introduced to Coron, and the town experienced another boom, a fishing boom. 
The population increased, as many people from Luzon and the Visayas came to work either as fishermen or miners. 
On June 17, 1950, Busuanga was officially created as a separate municipality from Coron and in 1954, Coron was further reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Linapacan. 
On September 12, 1992, Coron was finally reduced by the official creation of the Municipality of Culion. 
In the past, Coron was virtually unknown outside of Palawan. 
It remains a small, quaint fishing town with laid back charm but with increasing media exposure it is growing, slowly but steadily, 
Coron has taken an important position in the tourism industry. 
In the past decade, there has been a rapid influx of scuba divers and other tourists coming in, making tourism the major industry player in Coron today. 
How to Tell a Joke 
Two Parts: 
Getting the Material Right 
Getting the Delivery Right 
From one-liners to classic three-liners to the one-minute gag you tell your friends, a good joke pleases everyone. 
Joke-telling is one of the best ways to ease tension, make a new friend, or light up a room. 
That is, of course, if you can get a laugh. 
Telling good jokes is an art that comes naturally to some people, but for others it takes practice and hard work. 
Part 1 of 2: 
Getting the Material Right 
Know your audience. 
All aspects of the joke you tell, from the content to the length, need to be suited to your audience. 
What’s funny to a group of 20-year old college students may be very different from what makes your 70-year old-uncle laugh (then again, maybe not). 
Everyone’s an individual, so there are no hard and fast rules. 
But, unless you personally know the members of your audience, here are some good rules of thumb to follow: 
elderly people won’t like crude jokes; 
stay away from misogynist jokes if you’ve got an audience full of women; 
people of a specific ethnic or racial group won’t enjoy jokes making fun of their group; 
and jokes requiring specialized knowledge (of, for example, science or old movies) will only be appreciated by people who possess that knowledge. 
The more you know about your audience the better you’ll be able to tailor your jokes to them. 
Choose great material. 
You can find fodder lots of places — from your life, joke files online, by repurposing jokes you’ve heard in the past, and so on. 
You may want to start your own joke file. 
You can write your jokes down on index cards to keep them handy or use a document file on your computer. [1] 
The latter option may allow for easier revision. 
Decide on a target. 
Every joke has a “target,” which is what the joke is about. 
It’s important that the joke’s target (the most basic element of your material) be suited to your audience. 
Make sure it’s a target your audience will be interested in and something they’re likely willing to laugh at. [2] 
For example, husbands are likely to laugh at jokes about wives and vice versa; 
students will typically find jokes about school and teachers humorous. 
Have a realistic but exaggerated setup. 
The opening of the joke — or setup — should have a basis in the real world so your audience can relate to it, but it should also include exaggeration because this is what gives a joke its humorous edge. [3] 
Think of the setup as the foundation of a story. 
It’s a fundamental part of the joke; 
if you don’t lay a good foundation here, then the punchline won’t make sense to the audience or they won’t find it humorous. 
Your setup needs to be both realistic and exaggerated in order to be funny — 
it’s placing these two incongruous elements side by side that makes the joke funny. [4] 
The exaggeration can be slight or considerable — 
it just depends on the individual joke. 
Surprise with the punchline. 
The ending of the joke is obviously crucial. 
This is where the payoff comes in, what makes the joke succeed or fail. 
If you want to make the audience laugh, your punchline needs to be surprising. 
Some jokes also have what is called a tag or topper, which is an additional punchline. 
The tag builds on the original punchline or twists back on it in a surprising way. 
Make the joke your own. 
Lots of jokes rehash the same ground and sometimes they retell a story countless other jokes have told. 
For your joke to be funny, it has to surprise the audience in some way, which means it has to seem original or new. 
One way to personalize a joke is to change the ending. [5] 
Another option is to dress the joke up as a story about your own life. 
This will make a familiar joke unrecognizable. 
It may also make it particularly interesting if your audience is your friend(s). [6] 
Know your material. 
Practicing your joke is crucial. 
You don’t need to have it completely memorized — in fact, you "shouldn’t" memorize it — but you need to be really comfortable with it, so comfortable that you can continue on with telling it even if you get nervous or sidetracked, which is very possible once you’re in front of an audience. 
Memorized jokes sound wooden, like they are being read off a script instead of relayed by a friend or entertainer. 
Good jokes have a lot of details and personality, so don’t be afraid to embellish. [7] 
Try different things out and see what feels right, what sounds best. 
Don’t use a joke until you’re completely comfortable with it. 
Try recording your joke on a tape player and playing it back to yourself. 
If you hear a lot of awkward pauses or “ah”s or “um”s, your joke isn’t ready and you need to practice more. [8] 
You can also try practicing in front of a sympathetic friend or family member once you’re ready for a “real” audience. 
How to Wash Overalls in a Washing Machine 
Whether you are a working man or just a little cutie trying to stay cute, those overalls are going to need washing sooner or later. 
The straps on adults’ overalls often get so twisted during the wash that one wishes she had just used an old fashioned washboard instead. 
Your appliances are also murder on the straps, which are almost always the first things to wear out on your overalls. 
This article will show you how to save time and prevent wear, extending the life of your overalls until they are so soft you could wear them to bed. 
Steps 
Wash alone or with "like" clothing. 
It’s best to wash adults’ overalls alone, especially men’s. 
However, it is okay to wash just a few items with them, like blue jeans. 
What you don’t want to wash with them is anything that can get twisted up with the straps, like women’s long sleeve shirts or kids’ blankets. 
Think similar clothing, minus the twisty-ness. 
Just do the denim and canvas stuff together. 
Fasten the straps to the bib. 
If you didn’t know already, the bib is the top front part with the breast pockets. 
Go ahead and fasten both straps before you wash. 
This will help keep them from twisting up during the wash. 
Use twist ties to keep the straps fastened. 
This step will reapportion years of your life in the long run. 
Don’t skip it. 
Take the 20 seconds to use a couple twist ties on the fasteners to make sure they don’t come loose. 
If your washing machine is worth its salt, it will undo those straps in a heartbeat and tie them in a sheet bend unless you prevent it. 
All it takes is two twist ties and a few seconds of patience. 
Empty the pockets. 
Overalls have more pockets than pants. 
The bib has a wallet pocket and a watch pocket. 
Kids put rocks, candy, and bugs in these. 
Men put cell phones and small tools in them. 
Women defy the laws of purse-space, so when it comes to bib pockets, the sky is the limit. 
Make sure all the pockets are empty. 
Move the strap adjusters around. 
You’ve probably got them just the way you like them, but if you move the adjusters up or down on the straps occasionally, the straps will last longer. 
Depending on the adjusters, you may be able to leave them a little loose too. 
The straps wear out fastest around the adjusters over the course of numerous wash and dry cycles (not to mention being out in the elements if they are work clothes). 
Moving them distributes the wear and tear of washing. 
This is the same idea as rotating tires. 
You know about rotating your tires, don't you? 
Tips 
If you wash your overalls alone or in a light load, use about half the detergent called for and less water. 
Leave the straps fastened and twist-tied to the bib when you throw them in the dryer. 
This will cut down on some of the racket, but you're still going to hear them. 
Warnings 
The paper-type twist ties will deteriorate a little, but the dryer filter screen will catch the fallout. 
Plastic-type twist ties will hold up in the wash, but may or may not melt in your dryer. 
Use with caution.
