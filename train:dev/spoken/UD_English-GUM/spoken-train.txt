Cool. 
Alright folks. 
Well alreet, well alroot, well alright. 
By now I'm sure you're wondering about the different things that I have on the table here, but first, I would like to talk to you about these three items. 
I have here, some ice in a pan, water in this glass, and steam rising from this pot. 
Now, I would like to ask you, how these three things. 
Tell me please. 
How are they all alike. 
These three things. 
This ice here in this pan. 
This water in this glass, and the steam rising from this pot, just yell it out, we are informal here, yes. 
Correct. 
They are all forms of water. 
This ice here of course is water, I told you there was water in this glass, and you have all seen water boil at home, so you are familiar with steam. 
But now let's try to figure out how they're different, we'll look at temperature, first. 
And the temperature of this water here, the ice, is, about uh twenty-four – woo- nineteen degrees. 
Very cold. 
The temperature of this w- water here, is sixty-four degrees, the temperature of this steam, is, I know it's hotter than that. 
Yeah, it's about a hundred and eleven degrees. 
Okay. 
Fahrenheit. 
Okay. 
Oh, and by the way guys, what do we call something that's hard, like this ice here, or a table, or a rock? 
We call it a? 
Solid. 
Very good. 
You should g- — you should be a choir. 
You should go out on the road there, like, yeah. 
We are. 
Y- — oh well, I'm glad to meet you. 
Please give me your itinerary after the show. 
Yes. 
Yes. 
Of course we call it a sholids. 
A solid. 
And a solid has one shape. 
The shape that it starts out with. 
And what do we call something that you — that you can splish splash? 
Take a bath in. 
Anything wet like soda or milk. 
Liquid. 
You're not gonna let me finish, are you? 
Yes, we call it a? 
Liquid. 
Very good. 
And a liquid can change its shape, to f- completely fill the bottom of whatever container you put it in. 
And finally, what do we call something that's loose, and floating around like this steam here? 
Or a cloud, or the air we breathe, we call it a? 
Gas. 
Correct. 
A gas. 
And a gas completely fills whatever shape container you put it in. 
And so, how do you get water to change, from a solid, to a liquid, to a gas, and back and forth? 
Add energy. 
Woo. 
I like the way he expressed that. 
Never before have I heard it, add or subtract energy, or, heat, change the temperature, basically. 
Correct? 
Alright. 
Well folks, now I'm going to show you something else that happens when you change the temperature, and that's where these balloons come in. 
I have here a number of balloons, but, l- let's see how many of these balloons, I can fit, into this little itty-bitty container here. 
Well, everybody count together. 
This would be ... 
There's a- in there. 
You think, well, okay, w- th- th-, I'm glad I never saw d- Citizen Kane with you. 
Rosebud is a sled. 
Okay. 
Well, let's all count together folks, that was? 
One. 
One. 
Very good. 
One balloon going into the little container here. 
And this would be ... 
Two. 
Two. 
Very good counting there. 
Two. 
Excellent. 
Two balloons going into the little container here. 
Ah, they're not fitting in so easily. 
Oh no. 
So hopefully I can fit all balloons into this little container here. 
Oh stop guessing at what this is. 
Let's have some suspense here. 
Come on. 
Alright. 
And this would be? 
Three. 
Three. 
Very good. 
Three balloons going onto the the little container there. 
Three balloons. 
Three, yes, the balloon trinity. 
And now, this would be? 
Eight. 
Four. 
Four. 
Very good. 
At first he was confused, but then he figured it out. 
Everybody tell him what this is, it's ... 
Seven. 
It's four. 
Boy you people didn't watch enough Sesame Street as a child. 
This would be? 
Five. 
Thank you very much, yes. 
Five swollen balloons. 
In. 
In. 
Down. 
Down. 
Ah, ah. 
Okay. 
And this would be? 
Six. 
Six, good. 
And let's do this uh, let's add some complexities to this here, let's do it in another language. 
In Spanish it would be? 
Ocho. 
Seis. 
S- seis. 
N- ocho. 
Oh my gosh. 
I'm afraid for our nation. 
Okay, well, and this would be? 
Siete. 
Thank you. 
Seven. 
Right? 
Seven. 
Okay. 
And finally, this would be? 
Eight. 
Ocho. 
Eight, or ocho in Spanish, and uh huit in French, thank you very much. 
I thought you were telling me your breakfast. 
What you had for b- — But no, huit. 
Very good. 
Oh my gosh, eight balloons into this little container here, I bet you're wondering r- how that happened. 
You popped two. 
There's a hole in it. 
Well, there's a hole, no, if you're thinking there's a hole, think again. 
Because, there's no hole in the counter at all. 
Pull em out. 
You slowed down the molecules, 
Well – la duh dah dih duh duh, you're getting a little ahead of me son. 
Let's all figure it out together. 
So you don't need to go borrow equipment from anybody, to to do the feet? 
Do the hooves? 
Well, we're gonna have to find somewhere, to get, something 
So, Mae – 
I'm gonna na 
Mae Lynne 
We're not gonna do the feet today, I'm gonna wait till like, early in the morning, to do those, cause y- I mean you get so tired. 
N- you just, it takes well, it takes me longer than most people, cause you know, I'm not as strong and, and I'm not as good, as like somebody that would do it all the time. 
You know. 
I mean, oh I mean I trim horses, and stuff like that, but I mean, I'm not like, I'm not uh,. 
I don't know how to say it. 
But you know, they do it for a living. 
You know, most people that you would get to trim your horse do it all the time. 
And I'm not that good or, and I'm not very strong. 
Did they train you — 
Yeah. 
Did they train you that — 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
So you have your own equipment, but — 
No. 
I don't have my own equipment at all. 
Dad, you know, has done some of it. 
That's another thing too, is I kinda had a b- general idea, of kinda how to do it, just watching him. 
Or — and watching, people come to our place, and doing it and stuff you know. 
And, I don't know. 
Then, down there, um, it's mandatory. 
You have to — to graduate, you know, or well, to get the degree, you know, you have to take this class. 
And you can only take — if you want to, you can only take it for eight weeks. 
And, if you wanna go on in it, you n- — then, you can go on. 
You know. 
And I decided to go ahead and go on in it. 
And the first part of it, is like, well we have lecture, then we have lab. 
And like, the first part of it, we just go into the classroom, and he like ... 
In the beginning of the year there was a lot of classroom work. 
I mean, it — that's just kinda how it happens, you know, because he kinda has to tell you ... 
They go over the whole, the whole part of the horse. 
I mean, all the skeleton part of it you know, and — and they go through every kinda ligament. 
And I mean, there's, millions of ligaments, and millions of tendons, you know, well not millions, but, I mean ... 
Yeah, I bet. 
And then, so we had to know these tendons, and ligaments, and then, all the bones, and, you know, all the way up – from the shoulder down, and then from the hip down. 
You know, all the way down to the hoof, and then, the bone in the hoof, and, then all the wall, and, you know, of the hoof, and, what everything was called there, and then, he went over on how to trim it, and where you — 
Th- there's a white line, that you go by, and a horse has this little white line, and you clean it out with the — with the hoof knife. 
You know? 
And then there — and then you can see this little white line? 
And that's kinda where you go by, to — 
You know, the horse kinda helps you out, because it, has that little white line right there. 
Mhm. 
And that's where you kinda — kinda need a little guide, of where you trim. 
And, I am still scared to do it. 
Because, you know, I mean, you can make a horse go lame, by doing it. 
Really? 
Well you can trim em too short. 
And make em, you know, and they're just a little bit, for f- the first couple of days, you know, I mean they're just sore. 
That's not bad, but sometimes you can get it really bad. 
You can really make a horse really bad. 
And they m- 
You know then, they have to, like, keep em, away from anything, you know, get em really in the soft ground, and, no hard pebbles, or hard clods of dirt or anything? 
So, I don't know. 
I'm a little scared about doing it yet. 
You know, I get em really long. 
I mean they're still long, when I get done with them. 
A lot of times, like, I'll get done, and I'll think I'm done, and I'll look at – look down at the horse's hoof, and it's still, it's too long. 
And then like, I would never, ever, ever, trust myself, to shoe a horse. 
See we did that too. 
We did — we did a lot of stuff. 
We did a lot of stuff with the — like we had the, um, the burners? 
You know, and you'd put the — you'd have — you started out with the straight iron? 
You know? 
And you'd stick it into the, into the, you know like, actual blacksmithing. 
And you'd put it into the hot coals, you know? 
And then, we'd — I I – straight bar. 
And we'd make it a — a horseshoe out of it, you know? 
But, these shoes we never did put on a horse. 
We just put the shoes that were already made, on a horse. 
And that's as far as we got. 
I mean, if you would really get into it, well as a matter of fact, this is really funny. 
You know, there isn't really any girl farriers around anywhere. 
They're really — 
Farrier? 
Th- – yeah. 
Farrier is what they're called. 
And the m- — the reason they were showing us this at college, was just, to get us, to know if our trimmer, and shoer was doing it right, and — plus the knowledge of knowing the bones and ligaments. 
Which we, we had it in another class too. 
We — that was kind of a double thing that, we had in — in another class, so it was kinda review for us. 
Well it was a review for some people, depending on what time of the year you took it. 
You know. 
If it was a review or not. 
But, anyway, um, what was I gonna say? 
I forgot what I was think- — 
You said you never made the horseshoes. 
Gonna say. 
But. 
Well, w- um, when we put em on a horse's hoof, all we do, they're already made. 
They're round. 
We pick out a size. 
You know we'd like look at the horse's hoof, and say, okay, this is a double-aught. 
This is an aught. 
This is, you know. 
What s- — what size. 
And double-aught and aught, are the ones that are most popular. 
For, you know, the light horse. 
You know, I mean, you get into the big horses, the — like the Clydesdales, Shires, that's a d- — a whole different thing. 
Or ponies, that's a whole different thing. 
But we're talking just the regular, light horses you know. 
That's to Judy. 
You probably have one like it already. 
I don't know. 
I don't know. 
They show the uh –, some are l- lent, and some are — are gifts. 
To a museum. 
Oh. 
Oh yeah. 
Back here it tells you. 
Mhm. 
Where they came from. 
Oh Mom. 
Oh no, I don't have this one. 
Oh good. 
Joseph Campbell? 
Mhm. 
Oh yeah. 
Oh this'll be great. 
He's wonderful, hunh. 
I mean, he – he's dead now. 
Yeah. 
He died. 
Oh, this is great. 
Joseph Campbell. 
I'm just interested in when did she get that. 
Oh I got lot of these presents, you know, just along the way. 
Yeah. 
That's — on the way. 
Cause I don't wait till Christmas to buy everything. 
There are there are mysteries in this house that I'm not even aware of. 
Okay. 
Well – 
Open this one. 
From the gel- uh the elves. 
Oh, to Dan? 
Sa- me too. 
To Dan from Santa. 
Mhm. 
Oh. 
And this one is, to Dad, From Judy. 
Oh. 
Guess what that is! 
Oh, guess what! 
That is Dad. 
Oh. 
Okay. 
Look up. 
Look up babe. 
Wait. 
I would've had trouble figuring out what this one is. 
There we go. 
Okay. 
Now it — shall we wait to uh — 
Wait. 
Wait. 
There's another one for Dad down there. 
That red one. 
Oh. 
Yeah. 
Oh Dad, from Judy. 
Oh wow. 
Oh, alright. 
Just what you've always needed. 
You must've seen my other one. 
My other one is tearing, and falling apart. 
Oh yeah? 
I've only had it for at least twelve years. 
Probably more. 
Probably more like fifteen years. 
Good. 
I'm gonna go transfer the keys into this one. 
Oh great. 
Oh, this is good. 
Look, it's a bread baking pan. 
Oh alright. 
Yeah this is — this is great. 
Now, That's from Mrs. Santa. 
You can bake bread in that. 
Oh, this is great. 
Stainless steel? 
Hmm? 
Yep. 
Stai- – 
Stainless, unhunh. 
Oh. 
Well? 
You'd better wear it too. 
Uh-oh. 
You'd better wear it. 
Gosh. 
Hmm? 
Look at this. 
Oh wow. 
If you don't, I will. 
Yeah, now that I can wear. 
Will you? 
Yeah. 
Cause I know you don't wear sweatshirts. 
She's been saying for months that you would never wear it. 
If he doesn't — 
I'll — 
I will. 
I'll at least wear it once. 
I hope you like yellow. 
I have one the same. 
You do? 
I — I shrunk it down already. 
Yeah. 
Cause it was really huge. 
When I bought it. 
But, I thought that's the largest size they have. 
So. 
That's big enough. 
Wow look at this! 
That big enough? 
Yeah. 
Thank you very much. 
Yeah. 
It'll keep you warm. 
Looks good on you. 
There might be a little conflict of interest. 
Mhm. 
That it doesn't say Stanford over here. 
But the — 
Aw, so what. 
That's great. 
Oh. 
Thanks Judy. 
Oh that's — 
Well thanks for this. 
This is — 
Oh, you needed that, huh? 
Yeah. 
I'll make good use of this. 
Mm. 
Okay. 
Mm. 
Okay now. 
Now what. 
Um. 
In fact, what I'll do, is I will take this sweater off, and put the — 
Oh yeah. 
That's a great idea. 
Well whose — 
That one's to Dad. 
What hon? 
Isn't it? 
That's — 
Yeah. 
From me. 
Oh. 
I don't know if he wanted to open that or not, or not right now. 
You wanna open this one from me? 
Right uh now? 
Or late- — 
Wait till later. 
I'll wait till later. 
You know what it is? 
Okay. 
Yeah, he picked it out. 
Yeah. 
Well Dad always picks. 
I get a little picky on my shirts. 
Yeah, I know. 
People decide to — 
If it's too small, Mom can take it. 
No, it's not too small. 
It's perfect. 
Is it too big? 
Hm-m. 
Get you some tights to go underneath it. 
Been having too much of that rum fruitcake, kid. 
Oh is it? 
Down at the back. 
Is it? 
Hm. 
Oh good. 
Yeah. 
Fits good. 
Is it — 
D- is it too small? 
No, no. 
I still got room for another ten pounds. 
Good. 
You look good in it. 
Now let me take a picture. 
Yeah. 
I might just even wear that to work. 
Without a tie. 
Okay. 
I think you'll have to wait on that one. 
There. 
Got a good photo. 
Alright. 
Okay. 
Are all the rest of these from Diana? 
Uh, to Diana, and from — from Diana. 
T- what? 
To D- — 
T- – what? 
To Diana, and from Diana. 
Oh. 
Oh I see. 
So I thought we'd wait, to open her gifts and — 
And our gifts to her. 
Yeah. 
Uh, she can — 
She can't open em till she gets here. 
So, we'll just wait, on ours. 
Oh here's one you can open. 
Oh. 
Well, who's this from? 
Now you can open that. 
Right now. 
To Judy, from Mom. 
Mhm. 
So Erasmus laid the the — laid the egg, which Luther hatched. 
And um, when you come then, to, uh, however this debate. 
This freedom of the will. 
Um, I think uh, let me read you a page from Brendler. 
Because it sets the sa- stage very nicely. 
This is in the Luther book some of you are reading, and um, if you, this evening when you go home, if you wanna meditate it on more, on – on it more, it's on page three eleven. 
It's on page three eleven. 
But, let me just read you the –, cause this gives us the setting very nicely, and then we can uh, Erasmus entitled his anti-Luther pamphlet, Diatribe Concerning Free Will. 
Once again, the first and fundamental questions, disputed in fifteen sixteen, and fifteen seventeen, and again in Heidelberg, in April of fifteen eighteen, with which Luther had opened the assault on scholastic theology, were debated. 
Luther was glad to take up the theme of this debate. 
And this is what Luther writes to Erasmus. 
You alone, among all the others, have recognized the key question. 
And you do not bore me, with the Papacy, purgatory, indulgences, and similar nonsense. 
You, and you alone, have identified that on which all else hinges. 
And you have put the razor to the throat. 
And for that I thank you heartily. 
Um, thus Luther evalu- uh evaluated the subject. 
And Erasmus commented on the significance of their engagement, in battle, in his own style. 
And he wrote to Luther. 
Perhaps an Erasmus who writes against you, will do more for the Gospel, than certain dunderheads who support you. 
And then, humanistic thinking, will never consent. 
This is Brendler now, obs- – uh on this uh, but this sets the stage for what we're gonna talk about. 
Humanistic thinking will never consent to the doctrine of original sin. 
Pico de la Mirandela would not have consented to the doctrine of original sin. 
The author of uh, what is it, Houseman I think, of Invictus. 
I am the master of my fate, 
I am the captain of my soul. 
I don't think that he would acknowledge original sin. 
Is based uh, alright, what is it, it's based, as it is, on the concept, that human nature is totally depraved, and of itself not capable of any good will. 
And that apart from grace alone, free will is nothing, can do nothing, does nothing, except depraved deeds. 
Even though these pronouncements are Biblically based, and may be acceptable within an exclusively theological system, they do not appear reconcilable with the dignity of man- – dignity of man. 
Catholic, and semi-pelagianism, with all of its emphasis on on the role of prevenient grace, finally views free will as the decisive factor in attaining salvation, thereby conceptualizing free will, as similar to a healthy man- – healthy human understanding. 
For how can a person, be responsible for his deeds, if he possesses no free will? 
This is what Erasmus asked. 
How can he decide between good and evil? 
So reasoned Erasmus. 
Such arguments, long known to Luther, and many times presented to him, impressed him not in the least. 
God alone is salvation. 
God alone measures guilt. 
He alone condemns. 
He alone grants grace. 
Justifies and saves. 
When he will, and whom he will. 
Man can do nothing against the divine prerogative. 
Man can only accept the divine judgment. 
This is in fact best. 
And if by — and — and it is by the divine prerogative, that man will — uh, that man is well provided for. 
For God alone is infallible, and his being is grace and mercy. 
This concept, that man is divinely elected to salvation, or to damnation, is the center of the predestination dogma, that later, the Geneva reformer Calvin, made the center of his teaching, and that subsequently, under other historical preconditions and circumstances, could be linked closely with a prosperous middle class, in the Netherlands, and in England. 
Um, uh, skip this paragraph. 
This is the paragraph though. 
Right here, the next one, p- on page three twelve, when you, when you read – if you wanna read it later. 
Therefore, Luther did not accept rational arguments against predestination doctrine. 
Such arguments, on the contrary, necessarily appeared to Luther, given his theological orientation, as suspicious, from the very start, because they originated from human nature, which exalted itself against God. 
The whore reason prefers to submit to the Devil, adjusts to all situations, and proves everything, that is demanded of her. 
Human nature, does not possess free will. 
It is like a horse, ridden by God or the Devil. 
The rider possesses the will. 
The horse obeys. 
Well that's as clear as you can get it. 
Human nature is like a horse, ridden by God or the Devil. 
The rider possesses free will. 
The horse obeys. 
Alright that, th- now the debate is joined you see. 
And as you come — as Erasmus comes to this, he's going to say, well let's look at the Scriptures. 
Now, number one, we have to admit first – v- first off, that there seem to be passages, there are passages in the Scriptures. 
Are there not? 
Many. 
Which seem to teach, that man is responsible for his deeds, and that he may act, and has a free will to respond to the invitation of God. 
Isn't that clear in the Scriptures? 
Whosoever will may come. 
Um, Jesus turned to his disciples, you remember, when some deserted him, and seemed, because they were disappointed in some of his sayings, and they were offended by some of the things he said, and they walked no longer with him it said. 
And then he turned to those who remained, and he said, will ye also go away? 
They had a choice. 
Didn't they? 
Will you go away? 
What do you will? 
And the will, apparently was, re- resided in in these disciples. 
And so Erasmus is going to say, so obviously, in Scripture we have paradox. 
We have clear passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate that man has a free will, and that he can exercise that will, to follow, or not to follow. 
To respond or not to respond. 
On the other hand, we have passages of Scripture, which seem to indicate, that the will is not free, and that the –, and that man i- th- is – man is predestined by a an omnipotent sovereign will of God. 
Yeah. 
Do they have any kids? 
Hm-m. 
Have they been married a long time? 
I don't think Kathy can have kids, she's got a bad back. 
It sounds bad to me. 
She couldn't – she couldn't carry Laura. 
She had to be – Laura – She could hold her. 
As long as she didn't get up. 
Really? 
Yeah sh- she weighed all of ten pounds you know. 
She's all, heavy. 
She could – 
Well, maybe she does have quite a problem. 
M-mm. 
Some people d- could. 
I suppose. 
I mean, it's not impossible. 
Yeah. 
But – 
Tend to believe it's not as bad as sh- th- – 
How long have they been married? 
Um, Year and a half? 
I think, and, two years in November. 
Mm. 
What's Bill doing now? 
Hm. 
What are we in the process of? 
Your Bill. 
Not Bill Wilson. 
My Bill? 
Um, yesterday he was a carpenter. 
Your – 
He was a carpenter? 
Yeah he put a floor in a barn. 
Oh really? 
He put a floor in a barn. 
Well, he just fixed it, it had had one, and he was just replacing old rotten board. 
Oh. 
And stuff. 
I don't know what he's doing today. 
He was supposed to start baling hay, but I think they're gonna let it sit another day, cause he didn't take his lunch. 
What does he do when he doesn't take his lunch, come home? 
No Doris feeds him. 
Eats there. 
Hm. 
Would she feed him every day? 
Now explain all of this. 
I don't understand what not taking his lunch has to do with baling hay. 
Well if he was gonna bale hay, they wouldn't come in for lunch. 
They would just eat – 
While they're out there. 
Out there. 
Out in the field. 
I see. 
Yeah. 
Okay. 
If he didn't take his lunch every day, would she feed him every day? 
Yeah, she does. 
Feed him. 
I mean – well, when they're in the field, he has to take his lunch. 
That's just part of the deal. 
But – 
Otherwise he'll starve. 
Right? 
No, otherwise he doesn't get lunch. 
Well I know, that's what starving is. 
Actually, I think that if she found out he come and didn't have a lunch, she'd fix him one. 
Mm. 
Cause that's what she does with other people. 
Mm. 
But all winter she fixes him lunch. 
Oh, cause they're always close enough to – 
Actually it's more of a dinner, because it's – 
No lemon. 
I will go get you another one. 
N- that's alright. 
She just remembered. 
No, it's okay. 
Soon as I sat it down – sat it down I thought, no lemon. 
I knew it. 
Just – 
It – 
There's not enough lemon there to bother me. 
Thank you. 
Okay. 
But it tastes so good with lemon in it. 
I don't even like ice tea. 
Do you like hot tea? 
Yeah, I love hot tea. 
But the winter hasn't blasted cold enough for me yet. 
Do you put lemon in your hot tea? 
I'm going to today, cause I have a sore throat. 
Moi? 
Or toi? 
Well I answered – 
Schwa. 
I assumed it was me. 
I was talking to Beth, because she had the lemon. 
And the hot tea. 
I get it. 
Which you don't have. 
I get it, yeah. 
Oh I know. 
So what about you, Sherry, are you gonna put lemon in your hot tea? 
I don't put lemon in my hot tea, 
You ever do? 
I only do when I have a sore throat. 
I usually d- have, yeah, that's good. 
Lemon, or lemon and honey is good. 
Yeah? 
Now you won't be able to touch Jonathan. 
Just don't tell him. 
Because you're drinking lemon and honey? 
She's got a sore throat. 
No, because I have a cold. 
Oh. 
Well – 
Don't tell him, or don't tell Carolyn. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
And – 
Just don't tell him, 
Martha Jean sat there – 
And – 
And told all about how, sick Barbara Jean was, when she was tiny, and – 
And? 
That helped a lot, didn't it. 
Oh, Martha Jean, yeah. 
And what? 
Well, Carolyn was – 
I don't get it. 
Cause – 
I loved the little bit about the potty training. 
Eight months old and potty trained. 
She always says that. 
Oh my gosh. 
She told me the story of how uh, she trained all her kids by nine months. 
I'd – 
Well what was it? 
Now it's gotten back to eight, hunh? 
Oh Barb was at eight. 
Yeah, the boys weren't but – 
Oh well. 
They only – They didn't make it till nine. 
Who – who was it that's – 
Hunh? 
You know boys are slow? 
Yeah I know. 
That said that, that's not potty training, that's mother training. 
Oh yeah. 
Doctor Spock. 
Doctor Spock. 
How about Captain Kirk? 
What did he say? 
No no Sherry. 
You're an idiot. 
She's trying. 
It's Mister Spock, and Cap- 
I know. 
And Doctor Spock. 
Well, what was her story about Barb? 
That everyone – That was – 
She was in the hospital three times. 
Carolyn was so affected by, or unaffected or whatever. 
With asthmatic bronchitis. 
With bron- — 
And so, how did Carolyn react? 
Well – 
I – for some reason – 
She said thanks a lot, you know, because she was so worried about Jonathan. 
Oh sh- like oh, he's gonna go back again in other words. 
I said but – 
And then she told her that, she didn't outgrow it until she was five or something? 
She didn't have what? 
We are all going "Barb didn't outgrow it?". 
Oh "outgrow it". 
She was five or something? 
Mm. 
Oh. 
So Carolyn was really happy. 
So, yeah because C- – 
Like "oh this is great news". 
So then I said, "but look at Barb, she's healthy now", and Carolyn looked at her, and sort of looked away, and I thought, oh boy. 
Rude. 
Way to go Carolyn.
