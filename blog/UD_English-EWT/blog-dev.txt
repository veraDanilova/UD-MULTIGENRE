From the AP comes this story : 
President Bush on Tuesday nominated two individuals to replace retiring jurists on federal courts in the Washington area. 
Bush nominated Jennifer M. Anderson for a 15-year term as associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, replacing Steffen W. Graae.

Bush also nominated A. Noel Anketell Kramer for a 15-year term as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, replacing John Montague Steadman. 
The sheikh in wheel-chair has been attacked with a F-16-launched bomb. 
He could be killed years ago and the israelians have all the reasons, since he founded and he is the spiritual leader of Hamas, but they didn't. 
Today's incident proves that Sharon has lost his patience and his hope in peace. 
Nervous people make mistakes, so I suppose there will be a wave of succesfull arab attacks. 
A la guerre c'est comme a la guerre! 
In the eastern city of Baqubah, guerrillas detonated a car bomb outside a police station, killing several people. 
The US lost yet another helicopter to hostile fire near Habbaniyah in the Sunni heartland, but this time the crew was safe. 
In Fallujah, hundreds of demonstrators came out against US troops when they briefly arrested a yound newlywed bride. 
(I hope that the US army got an enormous amount of information from her relatives, because otherwise this move was a bad, bad tradeoff). 
The US troops fired into the hostile crowd, killing 4. 
It seems clear to me that the manhunt for high Baath officials in the Sunni heartland is being done wrong, or at least in ways that are bad for US standing with local Iraqis. 
Google has finally had an analyst day -- a chance to present the company's story to the (miniscule number of) people who haven't heard it. 
Usually, these are just a chance for the suckups to suck up, but this time people are actually concerned about the company's plans. 
They work on Wall Street, after all, so when they hear a company who's stated goals include "Don't be evil," they imagine a company who's eventually history will be "Don't be profitable." 
It's not quite as freewheeling an environment as you'd imagine: Sergey Brin has actually created a mathematical 'proof' that the company's self-driven research strategy, which gives employees one day a week to do research projects on their own, is a good, respectable idea . 
Read the entire article; there's a punchline, too. 
My opinion piece on the implications of Arafat's passing for al-Qaeda has appeared at Newsday. 
Excerpt: 
"Arafat's secular nationalism was supple enough to compromise with Israel and to imagine a two-state solution, even if the road of negotiations remained rocky. 
The continued Israeli colonization of the occupied Palestinian territories during the 1990s helped, along with terrorist attacks by radical groups such as Hamas, to derail the peace process, which Sharon had always opposed. 
Arafat's death creates a vacuum in Palestinian leadership that will not soon be filled. 
Sharon's assassination of major Hamas leaders has also weakened authority structures in that party. 
If the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership cannot find a way to reinvigorate the peace process, cells of radical young Palestinians may grow up that look to bin Laden for their cues. 
Even if local Palestinian leaders remain strong enough to keep al-Qaida out, the festering Israeli-Palestinian struggle remains among the best recruiting posters for al-Qaida with young Muslim men. 
Resolving this conflict would be the most effective weapon the United States could deploy in its war on terror." 
Xinhua reports that a wide range of Iraqi political forces on Tuesday condemned Sharon's murder of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, a religious leader of Hamas, the day before. 
The Board of Muslim clerics in Fallujah, 50 km west of Baghdad, "condemned the assassination and promised immediate revenge against the coalition soldiers in Iraq." 
Ash-Sharq al-Awsat reports that Fallujah was closed Tuesday in a general strike. 
US troops there clashed with guerrillas in a fight that left one Iraqi dead. 
In Ramadi, there was a big demonstration. 
Radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said the attack was "criminal" and that "the Zionists have left only one choice for the Arabs, that of fighting and jihad". 
The interim Governing Council issued a communique saying, "It is a proof of the emptiness of the Israeli authority and a destruction of the peace endeavors in the region . . . 
This operation would only consolidate the terrorist acts in the world and would not bring peace to the region," the message claimed. 
Xinhua alleged that "Many of the Iraqis, who suffer the American occupation of Iraq, relate their case with that of the Palestinian people, under the Israeli occupation." 
In an apparently unrelated incidents, some eleven Iraqis were killed by snipers on Tuesday, including a group of police trainees in a bus near Hilla and two police in Kirkuk. 
Ever since the first whispers about Google's IPO, most investors have feared that the stock would come public at such a ridiculously high price that, even with a spectacularly profitable business model and some nearly flawless execution, the price would be too high for investors to make a real profit. 
We've moved on. 
We've grown up. 
Now, people wonder if Google can even survive . 
That's overstating it, I know. 
What they wonder is whether Google can be anything more than what it's always been -- a great search engine with some real grass-roots support, successful by the grace of simplicity. 
Simplicity gave it that blessed, laudatory lack of clutter, the efficient and effective text-based ads, and the support of anyone with a dial-up connection. 
The problem is that customers attracted by a simple interface are among the least loyal you can find -- witness the fight-for-fewest-features between low-end camera companies. 
The other problem? 
It's tough to make money branching out when your appeal is in your focus. 
As the survey cited in the above-linked article shows, most Google users don't intend to use Gmail, and Google isn't even as popular as Yahoo! and AOL. 
If they continue to add features so they can justify their likely sky-high valuation, Google risks losing a huge chunk of their customer base to the next keep-it-simple search engine. 
Remember when a whole lot of people had to die because a Swedish newspaper printed those cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed? 
Now Iran wants to turn the tables and is inviting cartoonists to do their best by depicting the Holocaust. 
Amazingly, these idiots think a cartoon of Mohammed is comparable to what we can expect in this new fun contest: 
TEHRAN (AFP) - 
An international contest of cartoons on the Holocaust opened in Tehran in response to the publication in Western papers last September of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. 
"We staged this fair to explore the limits of freedom Westerners believe in," Masoud Shojai, head of the country's "Iran Cartoon" association and the fair organizer, said. 
"They can freely write anything they like about our prophet, but if one raises doubts about the Holocaust he is either fined or sent to prison," he added. 
"Though we do not deny that fact that Jews were killed in the (second world) war, why should the Palestinians pay for it?" 
Shojai told the opening ceremony of the month-long fair in Tehran's Palestine Contemporary Art Museum. 
He added that around 1,100 cartoons were submitted by participants from more than 60 countries and that more than 200 are on show. 
He said the top three cartoons will be announced on September 2, with the winners being awarded prizes of 12,000, 8,000 and 5,000 dollars respectively. 
This cute little stunt is only going to prove just how fanatic the extremist Muslims are. 
When they saw a cartoon of their prophet, people had to die. 
When their precious cartoons are released I highly doubt it will look like the end of the world. 
US Marines moved into most of Fallujah on Wednesday, though they were still meeting pockets of resistance. 
The Fallujah fighting has killed fair numbers of Iraqi noncombatants, including Shaikh Abdul Wahhab al-Janabi of the respected Association of Muslim Scholars. 
Armed clashes broke out in several northern Iraqi cities on Wednesday, leaving some 22 persons dead in Mosul, Baiji, and Tuz. 
Hundreds of persons mounted demonstrations against the Fallujah campaign in Tikrit and Huwaijah, as well, according to az-Zaman . 
The battles and demonstrations were provoked by the US assault on Fallujah. 
Guerrillas threatened to assassinate Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and Minister of Defense Hazem Shaalan in retaliation for the attack. 
Allawi's aged cousin and the man's wife and daughter-in-law were abducted and guerrillas threaten to behead them if the Fallujah compaign is not stopped. 
In Iraqi society, PM Allawi is responsible for protecting his clan, including especially his first cousins, so this kidnapping makes him look weak and brings substantial shame on him. 
The US Marines took most of Fallujah Wednesday, but still face pockets of resistance. 
If Samarra and other cities are any guide, those pockets of resistance could go on bedeviling the US for some time to come. 
The intrepid Ed Wong of the NYT has more on the Sunni boycott of the elections. 
He reports that the Iraqi Islamic Party, which had earlier been absolutely committed to getting out the Sunni vote, is now wavering and saying their position will depend on the situation. 
The outbreak of demonstrations and violence throughout the Sunni Arab regions on Wednesday did not bode well for Sunni participation in the January elections. 
Jim Lobe has more on the political implications of the Fallujah assault, both in Iraq and in Washington. 
For some black satire on Fallujah, see Unconfirmed Sources which has some fun with my Weblog. 
[Am at a conference and can't blog much right now but will try to catch up the next couple of days.] 
The hottest item on Christmas wish lists this year is nuclear weapons. 
Al-Qaeda wants them, Iran wants them, Russia wants the better ones, and all the US wants is to give them all a piece of coal. 
For the last few years there have been tensions with Iran’s nuclear program with word coming this week that a deal was reached through the European Union that meets with the approval of the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
At the same time, an Iranian Opposition Group released what they call proof of a covert nuclear weapons program. 
Arial photos, loose connections to AQ Kahn and Libya make up the evidence that the group presented. 
Russia also announced that it was seeking and building the best nukes the world’s ever seen. 
President Vladimir Putin said Russia is will have new nuclear weapons that other countries do not and will not have. 
With the demand so high, the question arises on to who should be or has the right to be the Santa of nuclear weapons. 
Right now that seems to be the US, EU, and IAEA. 
But not always do those three agree, and not always are their decisions equal. 
The US has strongly opposed a nuclear weapons program of Iran, yet Israel, which to this day has never officially said that they posses nuclear weapons, ranks around fifth in nuclear strength. 
It is estimated that Israel has over 200 nuclear weapons yet neither the US nor any of her allies expresses the slightest concern. 
North Korea’s Kim Jong Ill also has the bomb at the top of his list and Santa seems to have already come a few years ago. 
It is rumored that North Korea has at least a couple nuclear weapons. 
But getting past who should get them, is who has them, and who is really close. 
The case against Iran has a feeling of Déjà vu. 
Arial photos of the lab were uranium is being enriched, somewhat like those of chemical weapons stockpiles in Iraq. 
America cried wolf in Iraq, and what’s scary is that sooner or later, that wolf will probably get us. 
I ran across this item on the Internet. 
Sooooo. 
The United States goes into a war zone and evacuates a bunch of U.S. citizens (most of whom were "dual-citizens"). 
Then, eschewing normal procedure, the Department of State waived the fees that they charge for evacuating U.S. citizen. 
Why? 
To pander to the mythical "Arab street", of course. 
Now, I would argue that one could have reasonably predicted that some form of military violence was likely to occur in Lebanon (considering that the country has been experiencing some form of conflict for approximately the last 32 years). 
In other words, those Americans were there by their own choice, mired in a situation that was totally predictable. 
Yet we didn't charge them for the evacuation. 
This is unlike the situation last year in Asia when we evacuated U.S. citizens from areas that were hit by the tsunami - a phenomenon that is much less predictable than the Hezbollah-provoked destruction that rained down on Lebanon. 
And what do we get for this effort? 
A lawsuit. 
That's right, folks. 
The American-Arab Discrimination Committee is suing Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld, charging that they mismanaged the evacuation efforts. 
Here's an excerpt from the article: 
Nina Chahine, 19, who with her family was among the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said her wedding in the southern city of Tyre was set for July 13. 
The wedding had to be postponed as family members fled the outbreak of the war, she said. 
"We were on the road and the first bridge was bombed and we drove home and all the other bridges were bombed and there was absolutely no way for us to get home," Chahine told reporters outside federal court in Detroit. 
"We were all American citizens and there was no way that anybody helped us. 
No communications nothing. 
I was on my way to my wedding fearing death, basically." 
Chahine said her immediate family spent about $20,000 to return to Detroit via Syria and Jordan. 
Dear Nina, 
Here's a tip: Don't get married in countries that house illegal militias that attack other countries and hence are likely to come under counter-attack! 
Crap like this sure makes me want to rush right out and rescue people from dilemmas of their own making. 
Though I am loathe to quote other writers at legnth in this space, this little bit from Dan Froomkin's "White House Briefing" column in the WashPost today is just too good to pass up (read the whole column here ): 
At the Ask the President event on Friday, one of the questions was about whether Bush has any thoughts about his memoirs. 
This is one example of what happens when Bush gets a question that he hasn't anticipated. 
"Q Thank you -- I was wondering, there's a lot of talk right now about memoirs being written with the former President. 
After you are elected in 2004, what will your memoirs say about you, what will the title be, and what will the main theme say? 
"THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate that. 
(Laughter.) 
There is a painting on my wall in the Oval -- first of all, I don't know. 
I'm just speculating now. 
I really haven't thought about writing a book. 
My life is too complicated right now trying to do my job. 
(Laughter.) 
But if -- there's a painting on the wall in the Oval Office that shows a horseman charging up a steep cliff, and there are at least two other horsemen following. 
It's a Western scene by a guy named W.H.S. Koerner called 'A Charge to Keep.' 
It's on loan, by the way, from a guy named Joe O'Neill in Midland, Texas. 
He was the person, he and his wife Jan, introduced -- reintroduced me and Laura in his backyard in July of 1977. 
Four months later, we were married. 
So he's got a -- I'm a decision-maker and I can make good decisions. 
(Applause.) 
"And so we sang this hymn -- this is a long story trying to get to your answer. 
(Laughter.) 
This is not a filibuster. 
(Laughter.) 
That's a Senate term -- particularly on good judges. 
(Applause.) 
The hymn was sung at my first inaugural church service as governor. 
Laura and I are Methodists. 
One of the Wesley boys wrote the hymn. 
The painting is based upon the hymn called, 'A Charge to Keep.' 
I have. 
The hymn talks about serving something greater than yourself in life. 
I -- which I try to do, as best as I possibly can. 
(Applause.) 
"The book -- I guess one way, one thing to think about it is -- one of the themes would be, I was given a charge to keep. 
And I gave it all my heart, all my energy, based upon principles that did not change once I got into the Oval Office. 
(Applause.)" 
Now that's a rambling response. 
And I have to wonder: Did he forget that he already has a memoir called "A Charge to Keep"? 
That was the name of his "autobiography" -- ghost-written by adviser Karen Hughes in 1999. 
There has been random speculation about Google developiong a new browser and/or acquiring Firefox. 
It is true that Google has been in acquisition mode. 
They have acquired Urchin, Zipdash, Applied Semantics, Picasa, Blogger, and satellite imaging company Keyhole, so why not Firefox? 
I have no inside information, but I have been following links today that strongly indicate that Google is damn serious about securing permanent control of the leading edge browser technology in Firefox. 
Ben Goodger is the lead engineer for Mozilla Firefox. 
He announced this in January: 
As of January 10, 2005, my source of income changed from The Mozilla Foundation to Google, Inc. of Mountain View, California. 
My role with Firefox and the Mozilla project will remain largely unchanged, I will continue doing much the same work as I have described above - with the new goal of successful 1.1, 1.5 and 2.0 releases. 
I remain devoted full-time to the advancement of Firefox, the Mozilla platform and web browsing in general. 
He also announced this in January: 
Welcome Darin! 
I just want to extend a big "Welcome!" to Darin Darin Fisher who joined me at Google this week. 
2005 is going to rock! 
Darin Fisher wrote this response on January 25, 2005: 
Me and the big "G" 
Following on the heels of Ben's annoucement yesterday, I thought I'd post that I have joined Google as well. 
Like Ben, I will still be very much involved with the Mozilla project and community :-) 
Posted by darin 
Ben made another announcement on March 28, 2005: 
I want to use this opportunity to welcome Brian Ryner to Google! 
Brian has been one of the most crucial elements to the success of Mozilla software over the past few years,... 
Great to have you on board! 
Now, none of this has been confirmed by Google at the present time, but it's an old adage that you follow the money to see who is behind something. 
In this case, following the talent leads me to think that Google will be making an announcement this year that formalizes the Google-Mozilla/Firefox relationship. 
If you have not already seen the Flash movie Epic , you should take a few minutes and view the future history of media as conceived by Robin Sloan and Matt Thompson, with music by Aaron McLeran. 
In this movie Google and Amazon (GOOGLEZON ) create a brave new world of media in 2008. 
This is one thought-provoking film. 
Every move Google makes brings this particular future closer. 
Just one small commment - it's not possible, as far as I know, for Google to "Aquire" Firefox. 
They already have rights to take it, alter it, and release those changes to the world - this is what the whole open source thing is about. 
I'm inclined to say that google is doing what they can to both shape and support the growth of the most popular non-Microsoft browser out there - by taking on the leading lights in Firefox development, they're ensuring the continued life of the project, and ensuring (not that I think they need to) that their voice will be heard admidst the higher echelons of the firefox development team. 
It's this sort of enlightened self interest that keeps large open source projects alive. 
Fascinating viewpoint of the future in Epic. 
Thanks for the link. 
Malach, What you say makes sense. 
Acquiring open source talent gives a company an inexpensive way of influencing and anticipating the direction an open source project will go. 
It probably gives more bang for the buck than acquiring a private company and having to handle the inevitable culture clashes and process mis-matches. 
The Coalition decision to provoke a fight with Muqtada al-Sadr's movement only three months before the Coalition Provisional Authority goes out of business has to be seen as a form of gross incompetence in governance. 
How did the CPA get to the point where it has turned even Iraqi Shiites, who were initially grateful for the removal of Saddam Hussein, against the United States? 
Where it risks fighting dual Sunni Arab and Shiite insurgencies simultaneously, at a time when US troops are rotating on a massive scale and hoping to downsize their forces in country? 
At a time when the Spanish, Thai and other contingents are already committed to leaving, and the UN is reluctant to get involved? 
One answer is that the Pentagon prevented the State Department from running the CPA. 
State is the body with experience in international affairs and administration. 
The civilians in the Department of Defense only know how to blow things up. 
Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Feith staffed the CPA with Neoconservatives, most of whom had no administrative experience, no Arabic, and no respect for Muslim culture (or knowledge about it). 
They actively excluded State Department Iraq hands like Tom Warrick. 
(Only recently have a few experienced State Department Arabists been allowed in to try to begin mopping up the mess.) 
The Neocons in the CPA have all sorts of ulterior motives and social experiments they want to impose on the Iraqi people, including Polish-style economic shock therapy, some sort of sweetheart deal for Israel, and maybe even breaking the country up into three parts. 
The Washington Monthly's Who's Who of Neocons in Iraq helps explain the extreme incompetence and possibly double-dealing of many in the CPA. 
Sept. 11 Commission member Philip Zelikow, who is close to the Bush administration, admitted on Sept. 10, 2002, that the ulterior motive of the Bush administration for the Iraq War was to "protect Israel," according to the Asian Times . 
I have long been a trenchant critic of the Sadrists. 
But they haven't been up to anything extraordinary as far as I can see in recent weeks. 
Someone in the CPA sat down and thought up ways to stir them up by closing their newspaper and issuing 28 arrest warrants and taking in people like Yaqubi. 
This is either gross incompetence or was done with dark ulterior motives that can scarcely be guessed at. 
There is a classical logical fallacy, post hoc ergo propter hoc (Z happens after X, therefore Z is caused by X), and I keep revising this posting this evening because I don't want to fall into it. 
But sometimes, of course, when Z happens after X it is because of X. 
So I may as well just come out with it: It is pretty suspicious, given the Neocon predominance in the CPA and in the upper reaches of the Defense Department that on April 2 AP reported of Muqtada: 
' A radical Shiite Muslim cleric has expressed solidarity with the militant Palestinian group Hamas and said that he should be considered the group's "striking arm" in Iraq. 
"I have said and I repeat my expression of solidarity which Hassan Nasrallah called for to stand with Hamas," Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr said Friday in a reference to Nasrallah, the leader of the militant Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah. 
Last month, Nasrallah announced that his party would close ranks with Hamas. 
"Let (Hamas) consider me their striking arm in Iraq because the fate of Iraq and Palestine is the same," al-Sadr said during a Friday prayer sermon in Kufa, his home base south of Baghdad. 
He did comment on what he meant by the phrase. ' 
And on April 3 his chief aide in Najaf was suddenly arrested along with 13 other members of his organization, and the Coalition forces are put into violent conflict with his organization, which leaves 7 US soldiers dead. 
The Army is unlikely to forgive or forget; but who provoked it and why? 
I'm not even in Iraq and I could have predicted to you the consequences of doing what the CPA has been doing. 
Anthony Shadid of the Washington Post reveals that the warrants for the arrests had been issued months be for. 
Why were they suddenly acted on Saturday?
