What'd you do Sabrina? 
Nothing. 
I left the phone in my bedroom last night, and so I'm grounded from the phone. 
It was an accident. 
You guys are always in trouble. 
What's up with that? 
Mom's a bitch. 
Get your feet off of there. 
Get your feet off of there. 
You're so stupid thinking I spent the night. 
I came home last night and told you. 
Kendra, just let it go. 
You — 
No, because she doesn't — 
All you said last night was — 
She thinks I spent the night in my jeans — 
Kim wasn't staying the night. 
If I did spend the night, and I was trying to lie, I would give up, cause then I wouldn't care, cause I knew I deserved it. 
But I didn't spend the night, and I don't deserve this. 
Kim couldn't spend the night, I told you. 
She could, but then af- — I wanted to stay at the game longer. 
And her mom wanted to take her home early, and I'm like, no let's stay longer. 
But her mom wouldn't let her. 
And so she went home and, I was like, I'll call you when I get home, and then you come over. 
And she goes, no just spend the night. 
We'll do this some other weekend. 
Okay cool, cause she had to go bowling in the morning. 
Talk to Melanie's mom. 
Her mom would know. 
I'll have Melanie call you. 
Oh. 
Her mom call you, 
Right, right. 
Her mom wouldn't lie. 
Right, Melanie will call me to confirm your lie. 
Melanie lies but — 
You'll get a hold of her first. 
I know how that works. 
No, Melanie's mom. 
I thought Melanie didn't have a phone. 
But I'm supposed to call Melanie's mom. 
I didn't want you to have her phone number. 
Yeah, another lie. 
Remember? 
That was a long time ago. 
Now I'm supposed to re- — 
A- and I'm supposed to trust you every time you tell the truth. 
But how am I supposed to know when you're telling the truth? 
That was a joke. 
That was a joke. 
Yeah, and I'm supposed to read your mind and know what you're joking about. 
No but, it was a joke. 
You know Kendra, y- — I don't know how many times I gotta tell you, once you lie, once you lie — 
Are they having a carwash? 
You lose th- complete trust. 
No. 
Yeah they are. 
Yeah that's what it is a — 
We should have a carwash there. 
Carwash and a bakesale. 
They're not getting any people though. 
Mm. 
Hot out. 
What's that supposed to be? 
They're making it into something. 
You're not going anywhere for a while. 
It's a bookstore. 
Really? 
God, I didn't spend the night, that's what makes me so mad, I'm grounded for nothing. 
I was home all night last night, I came home and told you. 
And even my cuffs and everything's on my bed. 
So stupid. 
Next time if I leave in the morning, I'll wake you up. 
Mom I'm awake now, I'm leaving. 
Well you woke me up last night, to tell me Kim wasn't spending the night. 
I don't know why you couldn't wake me up in the morning, to tell me that you were going. 
You guys wake me up every time I'm trying to take a little nap. 
What if we are awake? 
I was tired this morning. 
So much fun. 
My hair looks like a mess. 
I left it in a ponytail, I didn't even have time to take a shower. 
I think if I spent the night I would've took a shower. 
All I need is your signature so I can play the volleyball. 
On the volleyball team. 
No. 
No. 
Why? 
It's just volleyball. 
It's f- like on Saturdays and Wednesdays. 
It's for church. 
It's fun. 
You have practice every Wednesday. 
Yeah but, not at uh — 
This is at six thirty. 
I don't care. 
And Susan's going to it too. 
Mm. 
Who cut the grass? 
Marlena did it. 
Marlena did it a long time ago, but it hasn't been watered. 
It's dying. 
I know. 
Gonna rip your purse. 
I know. 
See if I spent the night mom, you'd think I'd still be in my uniform? 
I know she's — 
J- she — 
See now she's trying to think of ways to cover her tracks. 
I know what you're doing. 
Seen this before. 
I'm hungry. 
Shit. 
I love your jeans. 
Cause I wanted to go to the bathroom when you're done. 
Anyways, they were not. 
Did you get a Sawzall? 
Yes, it's right here. 
Oh. 
I got the blades. 
They're right here. 
Do you remember the uh, program on TV, about Hantavirus? 
About what virus? 
Hantavirus. 
Hutter? 
What's that about? 
I don't re- – I don't remember. 
It's the one from the dead mice. 
Oh, yeah. 
Is it, is it all over now? 
Is it for real now? 
Is it in here? 
Is it in the United States now? 
They said, they already determined it was in like eighteen different states. 
What? 
So? 
The Hantavirus. 
What, what are you g- — 
Well — 
So what're you getting at? 
That insulation out there with the mice shit in it? 
Did you just wash — 
Yes. 
Really bothers me. 
I kn- — 
Oh oh I know. 
I mean that's the thing I thought of too. 
Well, it's all packed up in garbage bags now. 
I didn't even touch it. 
Used a hoe, stuffed it. 
I didn't touch anything. 
Don't touch anything yellow. 
Okay? 
Not with your gloves or anything. 
Find something else to pick it up with. 
Mhm. 
Did you — did you put it in a trash bag? 
I took that brown trash thing, and tucked a bag in it. 
And then I put them in there. 
Squashed em down. 
We need a — 
Do you have any sharp objects on you? 
No. 
Keys? 
No I need like a little pin or something. 
You have a pencil? 
You have anything in your hair? 
No. 
Fuck. 
What do you have to hit? 
See this is the little - 
Oh. 
Oh oh. 
Cool? 
Okay. 
Alright. 
See, it was just slow. 
Okay. 
This is me? 
Is this me? 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Jennifer. 
Oh. 
That's right. 
There you go thinking again. 
Smart ass. 
Smart ass. 
Alright. 
Wow. 
Who took over uh ... 
Oh. 
They got North America. 
But not for long. 
Oh, my God. 
Oh my God, did you see that? 
Because player thr- player three is aggressive, so he's gonna like go for everything. 
How do you know? 
Did I make him aggressive? 
Yeah, you made him aggressive, so, he's gonna like, try to tear everything up now. 
Um, that's pretty well, like secure right there, so maybe — 
That's me. 
Oh fuck. 
Wow, he wiped my ass out. 
Ah, you suck. 
Watch this. 
Loser. 
What else can we do tomorrow? 
Besides go to the movies, t-? 
Go out to dinner? 
I'm so not hungry right now, it's hard for me to think about food. 
Alright. 
I'd like to go out to dinner though. 
Think we can find a hot dog? 
Yeah, that's a good idea. 
That's an excellent idea. 
There you go thinking again again. 
There you go thinking again. 
I'm gonna whip your butt. 
You think so, hunh? 
Yeah. 
Un-unh. 
That's all I get? 
That's me, right? 
Yeah you get a percentage of the amount of countries you own, and then, for continents you get another set amount. 
So can I get something on this bad boy? 
Yeah. 
See? 
So I hit okay? 
Yeah. 
Hit okay. 
See you got one of each kind of card. 
Excellent. 
Oh okay. 
So I get ... 
So you got ten, looks like sixteen. 
Sixteen? 
Who you gonna trounce on? 
That's you up there, too, right there, you know. 
That's me right there, too. 
Oh yeah. 
Um ... 
When w- you take over another person, you take a — you get, their cards. 
The MSG in that Chinese food really got me high for a little bit. 
Does MSG affect you? 
No. 
Not really. 
It affects my mother. 
Gives her headaches. 
Are you gonna attack over there? 
I don't know. 
Thirteen. 
That leaves me with thirteen. 
I wanna fortify. 
You can't move those to there, because they're not touching. 
W- w- well that's kind of bogus. 
Nun-unh. 
Maybe I'll move em right there. 
Done. 
Done. 
Oh fuck. 
Oh. 
Who's this guy? 
Player six. 
Yakutsk. 
Look at that. 
See if I have any cards. 
Oh, I got a set. 
You know what I think, I think the first time that it does the card mode, it takes a long time. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
You remember the last time, that's what happened. 
Yeah. 
You remember? 
Yeah. 
Look at you being smart. 
I'm not smart? 
You're stupid. 
Don't call me stupid. 
Mm. 
Alright. 
Look at you with the uh little armies down here. 
Big armies. 
Trying to — trying to win. 
I got big armies, buddy. 
Trying to conquer the world. 
I'm gonna conquer — I'm gonna conquer you. 
Probably. 
Ooh. 
He's giving you some problems over there. 
He is indeed. 
Go for that one. 
Go into Europe. 
Get Europe. 
Oops. 
You won't attack me yet. 
I think I'll stop there. 
Hmm. 
I only have uh, that many cards, so ... 
How many cards you have? 
You only have two. 
Just two. 
So you can't have a set. 
When do you get — h- — when do you get cards though? 
I don't understand that. 
Every time you take over a country you get cards. 
What row? 
Attack with the twenty-two. 
Press twenty-two, attack. 
Wow. 
Look at that. 
Oh, see look, you just got all of his cards. 
Press okay. 
Bonus? 
Oh my God. 
Fuck. 
Fuck. 
Fuck fuck fuck. 
Oh man. 
Look at that. 
Twenty-seven. 
Twenty-nine. 
Th – twenty-one two three four five six seven eight. 
Twenty-eight. 
Don't you fucking attack me. 
You ass. 
You asshole. 
Two — hmm. 
I'm tired.
