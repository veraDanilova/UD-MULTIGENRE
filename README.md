# UD-MULTIGENRE

A dataset of instance-level text genre annotations from the paper:

**"UD-MULTIGENRE - a UD-based dataset of instance-level genre annotations"** (Danilova, V., Stymne, S., to be published at The Workshop on Multilingual Representations Learning, EMNLP 2023)



It is based on the data from the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) treebanks. It currently covers 17 text genres in 38 languages. The total size of the dataset (training and development) in tokens is 11096.9k, and in sentences - 657.4k. In addition, the test set currently includes data from 17 treebanks for five genres and 14 low-resource languages (119k tokens and 7.2k sentences).

The dataset enables new research as well as re-evaluation and a deeper understanding of prior research on genre-based data selection for cross-lingual dependency parsing. In addition, it is highly relevant for the research direction that investigates cross-lingual genre representation and classification.
