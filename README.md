# UD-MULTIGENRE
A dataset of instance-level text genre annotations from the paper:

**"UD-MULTIGENRE - a UD-based dataset of instance-level genre annotations"** (Danilova, V., Stymne, S., to be published at The Workshop on Multilingual Representations Learning, EMNLP 2023)

It is a reorganization of 63 treebanks from UD version 2.11 [Universal Dependencies](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11234/1-4923). It currently covers 17 text genres in 38 languages. The total size of the dataset (training and development) in tokens is 11096.9k, and in sentences - 657.4k. In addition, the test set currently includes data from 17 treebanks for five genres and 14 low-resource languages (119k tokens and 7.2k sentences).

The dataset enables new research as well as re-evaluation and a deeper understanding of prior research on genre-based data selection for cross-lingual dependency parsing. In addition, it is highly relevant for the research direction that investigates cross-lingual genre representation and classification.

The repository contains the following data: 
- **train:dev** Under each genre-specific directory, you'll find a list of treebank folders with the corresponding training and development .conllu and .txt files
- **test** In each genre-specific directory, you'll find a list of treebank folders with test data in .conllu and .txt formats
- **genre_prefix_map.json** This file stores the details on the identified sources for each prefix pattern. It has the following levels:
     * **Level-1:** Genre
     * **Level-2:** Language
     * **Level-3:** Treebank name
     * **Level-4:** Prefix patterns accompanied with descriptions and source where possible:
```
{
    "QA": {
        "Dutch": {
            "Alpino": {
                "sent_id = qa": "questions  used in a QA project (source)[https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Dutch-Alpino/tree/master]",
                "sent_id = wpspel": "questions  used in a QA project (source)[https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Dutch-Alpino/tree/master]"
            }
        },
        "English": {
            "EWT": {
                "sent_id = answers": "Question-answers are posts from Yahoo!s community-driven question-answering web site, Yahoo! Answers, where individuals submit and answer questions which may be on any topic. This data was collected in 2011 (source)[https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2012T13]"
            }
        },
...
```
**nopattern** value of prefix pattern is used mostly for single-genre treebanks where the whole treebank is assigned to a specific genre.
