Fourthly, do not say we were not available! 
It would certainly be counterproductive to make an offer, as some have already tried, when the Russians want nothing to do with it. 
In our proposals in relation to Agenda 2000 we considered the probable future trend of competition between pigmeat and beef. 
Should we find at any point that this is not the case, we will take the appropriate steps. 
I must admit I see the question of a world market orientation rather differently from the way it was presented a moment ago. 
Joint motion for a resolution on the crisis in the pigmeat sector 
We favour a reform involving the alignment of prices to world market prices and a reduction in export refunds. 
Finally, I should like to point out here the significance of a proposal put forward by our colleague Edouard des Places. 
I see this proposal as establishing some sort of precedent. 
It was quite a poignant fact that I was away on that particular Friday. 
We need foreign investors in places such as Telford, north Shropshire, Hereford, Ross-on-Wye and Wyre Forest. 
I would certainly not want farmers in countries that do not want to join the euro to be penalised. 
The 2.6 -% margin of fluctuation is nothing new; it already exists within the present system and is already being applied. 
The flat-rate approach produces more risk of overcompensation, which is why we have set the margin at 2.6 -%. 
A strong euro will therefore penalise European agricultural exports. 
Under these conditions, what will the future of the rural areas of Europe be like as a consequence? 
We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development feel that this form of production should be encouraged. 
Too little is being done in this area. More needs to be done, but we must avoid creating more bureaucracy. 
I have nothing against putting quality goods on the world market when it is a matter of competition. 
Firstly, it proposes the adoption of a regulation improving the transparency and authenticity of quality marks. 
It then proposes the creation of a European quality mark based on respect for the environmental criteria for production. 
The market in agricultural products is therefore no longer linked exclusively to price, but to the region. 
We in Parliament would like to add a third category covering organic products that also comply with environmental and animal protection criteria. 
I was recently in Poland for the Joint Parliamentary Committee. 
But that is precisely why we first need a clear strategy. 
At this stage, it still seems a little too soon to take a final position on this question. 
We support the introduction of a European quality mark, which takes account of animal welfare and the environment. 
Secondly, we can not support proposals for the split in funding or criteria in relation to the new Structural Fund regulation. 
We welcome the introduction of conditional clauses for the second payment. 
The results of the fourth phase of the Objective 2 programme, whose priority is job creation, are relatively pleasing. 
Thank you, Mr Donnay. 
Mr Escola Hernando is speaking for the first time in this House. 
Mr President, I should merely like to answer Mr Kellett-Bowman in one sentence. 
The Chair has already stated that the proposal was made in accordance with the Rules, so there are no grounds for changing anything. 
Our group has tabled several amendments in this direction. 
The programme has also contributed to the activities of 50000 creative or performing artists and other specialists in the cultural sector. 
The decisions were adopted unanimously. 
The joint debate is closed. 
That concludes Parliament's agenda. 
Adjournment of the session 
Yesterday it was my privilege and pleasure to be permitted two minutes' speaking time in this House. 
It was obviously out of excitement at this great event that I forgot to sign the register. 
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a good thing that the details of Members' attendance are corrected. 
That is wrong. 
This item has been correctly placed on the agenda and will be put to the vote at 12 noon today. 
The deadline expires today, so if we do not vote, we shall miss the opportunity to deliver our opinion. 
Preparing a Union-wide harmonising directive on as complex a matter as energy is certainly a complicated business. 
I believe that the Commission's initial approach was wise, because the problem calls for countless exceptions to the general rule. 
Madam President, our colleague, Mr Cox, has done some excellent work on the Commission's proposal. 
The Green Group fully agrees with Mr Spencer that we must preserve this proposal for a CO2 tax. 
The taxes will end up in the German Treasury instead of the Danish Treasury. 
Nonetheless, I should like to take up two points which are mentioned in the Environment Committee's report. 
I should also like to know how you view the timing. 
This is legislation requiring a unanimous vote in the Council, which is usually a guarantee of inaction. 
This indexing also includes the notion of an accelerator. 
In other words, there is a conflict between the parafiscal and fiscal aims; you can not have your cake and eat it. 
That technological effort would be penalised and competitiveness on the international field jeopardised. 
In light of this situation, we find it difficult to accept a number of unilateral proposals that were put forward. 
It is therefore unacceptable to compel the Member States to apply increases that are actually above the rate of inflation. 
You can regulate the market, but you can not regulate nature, the weather and the harvest. 
In one amendment, there is a call for the inclusion of pure and simple renewal of vineyards in the restructuring measures. 
Nevertheless, we want to limit the Council regulations to general provisions and to cover the remaining provisions in implementing regulations. 
Everyone will therefore understand why I am rejecting them. 
I would like to start with the Convention on third-country nationals, which is certainly the more complex legislative project. 
The mere offer of a job was to be sufficient to justify immigration rights. 
They have not all been met, but a great many have. 
Secondly, I believe that it is time for the European Parliament to set an example. 
On the other hand, these initial criteria should also include provisions allowing for the list to be abolished. 
Such a situation is unacceptable. 
I am all for thought being given to this and for seeking solutions. 
We must help them to improve their border security. 
It is the whole political class that is being questioned about the way in which it must take up these challenges. 
Finally, I should like to say that the policies at the centre of our debate are part of an overall picture. 
I would also like to say something about the two amendments tabled by my group. 
We want things to be regulated properly so that the problem can be brought under control. 
He has consistently linked immigration with unemployment, insecurity and criminality, as if evil always comes from elsewhere. 
I would really like to know how you can escape into Europe. 
We have been discussing this subject ever since I have been in Parliament. 
I hope they will be rejected because they are really the epitome of what Parliament is not able to do. 
Consequently, I had hoped to be able to count on a clear expression of support from the European Parliament. 
Naturally the Commission will do its best to ensure that progress is made. 
The regulation that was annulled was based on Article 100c of the Maastricht Treaty. 
The debate is closed. 
I thought it appropriate to retable at second reading three of the 12 amendments rejected by the Council. 
I have to admit that I had serious misgivings during the first reading of the directive. 
Perhaps we are only further complicating a matter which should really have left Parliament as quickly as possible once a decision had been reached. 
Chemicals are still on our agenda in the EU. 
There has been excellent cooperation on this highly technical proposal. 
Thank goodness we have finally reached the last stage before adoption. 
Parliament agreed to urgent procedure for 22 March 
Amendment of the Rules of Procedure 
They leave space and gaps to fill in. 
This new legally binding vote is highlighted in the revision of the Rules by describing it as the election of the Commission. 
They include provisions for dealing with the new High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. 
I shall not go into details on the High Representative, as his or her function has already been extensively debated. 
Finally, now that I am discussing resources, new technologies and speaking time, my own speaking time has elapsed. 
The second part makes it clear that benefits of a value greater than ECU 100 must be declared. 
The report is also imprudent in introducing issues not included in the mandate given by the Conference of Presidents. 
The opinion must be expressed when the vote on the full text is taken in committee. 
But that is not really my problem. 
What I criticise is the spirit underlying these amendments. 
This is the last rule in our Rules of Procedure and it concerns the annexes. 
Let me begin by saying that I do not intend to talk about my own report. 
Notwithstanding this, we shall certainly consider the suggestions put forward by the Socialist Group. 
The first concerns the proposal that would prevent political groups being formed of Members from one country only. 
The second issue is that of incentives. 
I believe it is workable, though it may be somewhat complicated. 
I am no fanatical defender of profits for pharmaceutical industry multinationals. 
We support Professor Cabrol's attempt to get things moving and put the uncertainties behind us. 
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the present proposal for a regulation is certainly to be welcomed. 
of course we can do so directly through support for research, and we shall continue to do so in future. 
But we also want to create a range of additional incentives, for instance through the ten-year market exclusivity right. 
The Member States would have to do so. 
I am very glad that some Members also spoke in favour of a special committee, during the debate. 
But then you must remember the aim of our proposal. 
That is why we want to support research rather than make it more difficult. 
We believe that is a risk we should not necessarily take on. 
For by definition an orphan drug is precisely a drug that offers very limited prospects of making a profit.
